Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
1.0 Executive Summary
1.1 Incident Summary
On August 6, 2012, the Chevron U.S.A. Inc. Refinery in Richmond, California, (“the Chevron Richmond
Refinery”) experienced a catastrophic pipe failure in the #4 Crude Unit (“the crude unit”). The pipe, a 52-
inch long carbon steel piping component of the #4 sidecut line, ruptured and released flammable,
hydrocarbon process fluid, which partially vaporized into a large vapor cloud that engulfed 19 Chevron
employees and ignited. All of the employees escaped, narrowly avoiding serious injury. The ignition of
the flammable portion of the vapor cloud and subsequent continued burning of the hydrocarbon process
fluid resulted in a large plume of particulates and vapor traveling across the Richmond, California area.
Approximately 15,000 people from the surrounding area sought medical treatment due to the release.
1.2 Interim Report
The CSB released an Interim Report on the Chevron incident in April 2013 (“the Interim Report”), which
highlighted technical findings and safety system deficiencies. Testing conducted on the ruptured pipe
determined that it had experienced extreme thinning near the rupture location due to sulfidation
corrosion.1 Sulfidation corrosion is a damage mechanism that causes thinning in iron-containing
materials, such as steel, due to the reaction between sulfur compounds and iron at temperatures ranging
from 450 °F to 800 °F.2 This damage mechanism3 causes pipe walls to gradually thin over time, and is
common in crude oil distillation4 where naturally occurring sulfur and sulfur compounds found in crude
oil feed, such as hydrogen sulfide,5 are available to react with steel piping and equipment. The Interim
Report stated that virtually all crude oil feeds contain sulfur compounds and, as a result, sulfidation
corrosion is a damage mechanism present at every refinery that processes crude oil. Sulfidation corrosion
can cause thinning to the point of pipe failure when not properly monitored and controlled.
The Interim Report noted a number of causal safety system deficiencies that highlight regulatory gaps
relating to major accident prevention at California petroleum refineries. For example, in conducting its
process hazard analysis
6
(PHA) of the crude unit, which was required under California’s Process Safety
1 With respect to the sulfidation corrosion damage mechanism that caused the Chevron incident, carbon steel piping
corrodes at a rate that is significantly faster than other materials of construction, such as high chromium steels,
including stainless steel.

3 Piping damage mechanisms are any type of deterioration encountered in the refining and chemical process industry
that can result in flaws/defects that can affect the integrity of piping (e.g. corrosion, cracking, erosion, dents, and
other mechanical, physical or chemical impacts). See API 570. "Piping Inspection Code: In-Service Inspection,
Rating, Repair, and Alteration of Piping Systems." 3rd ed., Section 3.1.1.5, November 2009.
4 Distillation separates mixtures into broad categories of its components by heating the mixture in a distillation
column where different products boil off and are recovered at different temperatures. See
http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=6970 (accessed April 4, 2013).
5 Hydrogen sulfide is the most aggressive sulfur compound that causes sulfidation corrosion.
6 A process hazard analysis (PHA) is a hazard evaluation to identify, evaluate, and control the hazards of a process.
Facilities that process a threshold quantity of hazardous materials, such as the Chevron Richmond refinery, are
required to conduct a process hazard analysis per the California Code of Regulations Title 8 Section 5189, Process

Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
Management (PSM) standard,7 Chevron did not conduct a rigorous review of corrosion and damage
mechanisms present in the crude unit, and did not identify sulfidation corrosion as a hazard. As such,
Chevron did not effectively address inherent safety8 or implement effective controls to prevent sulfidation
corrosion, including those controls proposed by Chevron’s technical group. Although both the California
and federal PSM standards require that hazards be identified, evaluated, and controlled, there is no further
discussion of how far to reduce risks, and there is no requirement to address the effectiveness of controls
or to use the hierarchy of controls.9 Therefore, this type of analysis was not required to be conducted, and
Chevron was never cited post-incident for failing to evaluate the effectiveness of safeguards.
In another example, despite internal recommendations to replace the entire #4 sidecut piping with an
inherently safer, more corrosion-resistant material of construction through the Management of Change
(MOC) process, incident investigations, technical reports, and employee recommendations, Chevron
repeatedly failed to implement those proposed recommendations. Chevron’s 2006 MOC analysis limited
application of those recommendations to only a small section of the pipe. As a result, the portion of the
pipe that failed on the August 6th incident remained in service until the incident. As there is no
requirement to implement effective recommendations or control hazards under the MOC element, it is
essentially an activity-based requirement. Chevron was not cited for narrowing the scope of the MOC,
despite its disregard of internal recommendations. The CSB concluded in its Interim Report that Chevron
did not regularly or rigorously apply inherently safer technology, which provides an opportunity for
preventing major accidents, in its PHAs, MOCs, incident investigation recommendations, or during
turnarounds.
The CSB made safety recommendations in the Interim Report to a number of entities, including the
California State Legislature, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and Contra Costa County. The
Board recommended that the California State Legislature require California petroleum refineries to
perform damage mechanism hazard reviews, to identify and report leading and lagging process safety
indicators, to document recognized methodologies, rationale, and conclusions used to claim that
safeguards intended to control hazards will be effective, and to document their inherently safer systems
analysis and the hierarchy of controls in establishing safeguards for process hazards, with the goal of
driving risk of major accidents to as low as reasonably practicable, or ALARP. These concepts,
introduced in the Interim Report and highlighted in the recommendations, are the basic building blocks
for the implementation of the safety case regime, a regulatory scheme that will be discussed in great detail
in the following report.
The CSB concluded its Interim Report by highlighting additional issues that were still under
investigation, including emergency planning and reporting, emergency response, safety culture, and
regulatory oversight of petroleum refineries in California. The following report fulfills the CSB’s
Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials (1992). PHAs are also required by the California Accidental
Release Prevention Program and the federal EPA Risk Management Program.

commitment to examine whether the implementation of the safety case regulatory regime could be a more
effective regulatory tool to achieve major accident prevention for California petroleum refineries. The
reader will find additional issues, arguments, and counterarguments regarding the safety case regulatory
regime addressed in Appendix C of this report.
1.3 Background
Although both the federal and California PSM standards, respectively, were intended to be goal-setting or
performance-based,10,11 in practice they appear to function primarily as reactive and activity-based12
regulatory schemes that require extensive rulemaking to modify. As a result, the federal and California
PSM standards have become static in the face of advancing best practices and technology, with the
emphasis placed on the completion of a task or activity rather than achievement of continuous risk
reduction.13 Many regions around the world such as the United Kingdom (UK), Australia, and Norway
have acknowledged similar deficiencies and have implemented regulatory regimes consisting of both
prescriptive14 and goal-setting elements that require duty holders15 to demonstrate to the regulator through
rigorous reviews and audits that they have reduced risks to as low as reasonably practicable, or ALARP.
This is referred to as the safety case regulatory regime.16 The safety case regulatory regime is a rigorous
prescriptive and goal-setting regulatory approach applied globally both onshore and offshore. It is
highlighted by its adaptability and requirements for continuous improvement in risk reduction for high
hazard industrial facilities. A written case for safety, known as the safety case report, is generated by the
duty holder and is generally rigorously reviewed, audited, and enforced by highly technically competent
inspectors with skill sets familiar to those employed by the industries they oversee. Despite this global
shift, the US has persisted in the use of a more activity-based regulatory scheme that lacks the ability to
adapt to advancing technology and recently developed industry standards, and which has failed to
adequately engage companies and their employees in continuous improvement and risk reduction with
similarly-skilled inspectors.
10 Also referred to as performance-based regulations, goal-setting regulatory requirements and acceptance criteria
are specified and industry must document that their specific solutions meet such requirements, e.g. in terms of
acceptable risk levels.

13, 2013).
12 Activity-based standards and regulations require the mere completion of an activity and do not focus on the
effectiveness of major accident prevention or risk reduction.
13 As will be discussed below, certain sections of the PSM standard have elements of a performance-based
regulatory approach.
14 A prescriptive regulation or standard describes the specific means or activity-based actions to be taken for hazard
abatement and compliance. Performance or goal-based regulations, on the other hand, state the objective to be
obtained (such as risk reduction or hazard abatement) without describing the specific means of obtaining that
objective.
15 Duty holders are considered to be “those who create and/or have the greatest control of the risks associated with a
particular activity. Those who create the risks at the workplace are responsible for controlling them.” HSE.

16 Norway’s offshore regulatory regime is not referred to as the safety case regime, but it does contain many of the
same elements as the safety case regime, with some differences in style, substances, and implementation.

Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
1.4 Key Findings
Technical
1. In the ten years prior to the incident, highly knowledgeable and experienced Chevron technical staff
repeatedly recommended that inspectors perform 100 percent component inspections on high temperature
carbon steel piping susceptible to sulfidation corrosion. These recommendations were not implemented
by Chevron management.17
2. Chevron technical staff recommended implementing inherently safer designs through the MOC
process, incident investigations, technical reports, and past recommendations from employees. However,
Chevron failed to implement proposed inherently safer recommendations prior to the incident. For
example, an inspection recommendation to upgrade piping to 9-Chrome was made, but the MOC to
implement the recommendation narrowed the scope, allowing the 52-inch component that failed to remain
in service.
3. In January 2007, a failure due to sulfidation corrosion caused a fire in the Chevron Richmond
Refinery crude unit, initiating a shelter-in-place for the surrounding community. A carbon steel piping
spool18 failed catastrophically during operation. Chevron informed Contra Costa Health Services’
Hazardous Materials Program19 in a letter that the crude unit piping metallurgy had been upgraded
following this incident as an inherently safer solution. However, this upgrade was limited to only the
immediate piping spool that had failed. The inherently safer, more corrosion resistant metallurgy was not
implemented more broadly in the crude unit as a result of this incident.
4. Chevron and Chevron Energy Technology Company metallurgists, materials engineers, and piping
inspectors had expertise regarding sulfidation corrosion. However, they had limited practical influence to
implement their recommendations. They did not participate in the most recent crude unit PHA, and they
did not affect decisions concerning control of sulfidation corrosion during the crude unit turnaround
process.20
5. The 2009 crude unit PHA did not identify corrosion as a potential cause of a leak or rupture in piping.
The PHA cited non-specific, judgment-based qualitative safeguards to reduce risk, such as: utilizing
metallurgy to minimize corrosion, having effective maintenance and inspection programs, and providing
pipe wall corrosion allowances.21 The effectiveness of these safeguards was neither evaluated nor
17 These recommendations are discussed in detail in paragraphs 44 through 51 of the Chevron Interim Report.
18 A piping spool is a small, removable section of piping. In some cases, a piping spool is installed or removed in
order to provide a temporary connection or complete disconnection between two piping circuits.
19 Contra Costa Health Services’ Hazardous Materials program is designed to respond to emergencies and monitor
hazardous materials within Contra Costa County. See http://cchealth.org/hazmat/ (accessed April 17, 2013).
20 The turnaround process includes both the planning stage prior to the shutdown and the activities staged during the
shutdown.
21 Corrosion allowance refers to extra wall thickness added as a safety factor to the design of a piece of equipment
beyond that needed solely for mechanical considerations such as design temperature and pressure. This extra
thickness is provided to accommodate for expected loss of wall thickness due to corrosion over the life of the
equipment.
10

Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
documented; instead the safeguards were merely listed in the PHA. Had the adequacy of these safeguards
been verified, improved safeguards intended to protect against sulfidation-induced failure of carbon steel
piping could have been recommended.
Regulatory
6. Following the August 6th incident, California’s Division of Occupational Safety and Health
(Cal/OSHA) inspected the Chevron facility and issued citations. Only one citation was related to PHAs;
and it was not associated with evaluating the effectiveness of safeguards. Rather, the emphasis was that
Chevron’s PHA did not adequately account for hazards caused by other units associated with the crude
unit. Had the California PSM standard required documentation of the effectiveness of safeguards,
Chevron would have been obligated to conduct this analysis.
7. There is a significant discrepancy in the compensation between the California regulators and the
Chevron Richmond Refinery personnel they interact with. The California regulators also lack the
technical staff with the necessary skills, knowledge, and experience to provide sufficient direct oversight
of petroleum refineries in California.
8. The CSB has examined records that demonstrate a considerable problem with significant and deadly
incidents at petroleum refineries over the last decade. The EPA has noted 234 recordable accidents at
petroleum refineries between 2000 and 2010. This is more than any other industry despite the fact that
the nation’s petroleum refineries make up only roughly one percent of the some 13,000 facilities covered
by the EPA’s Risk Management Program. In 2007, OSHA stated that according to its IMIS (Integrated
Management Information System) database, since May 1992, 36 fatality/catastrophe (FAT/CAT)
incidents related to HHC releases in the refining industry occurred. These incidents included 52
employee deaths and 250 employee injuries, 98 of these injuries required hospitalization. This number
surpassed the combined total of the next three highest industries over the same period. In 2010, an OSHA
official testified to a Congressional Subcommittee that over 20 major incidents resulting in injuries or
fatalities across the country occurred between 2005 and 2010, including the Tesoro Anacortes explosion
and fire in Washington. These incidents all repeated a lesson that should have already been learned by
the industry. Finally, in 2012 alone, the CSB tracked 125 significant process safety incidents at US
petroleum refineries. Seventeen of these took place in California.
9. Under the existing regulatory regimes for onshore petroleum refineries in the US and California, such
as the PSM and RMP programs, there is no requirement to reduce risks to ALARP. For example, under
both PSM and RMP an employer must “control” hazards when conducting a process hazard analysis
(PHA) of a covered process. However, there is no requirement to address the effectiveness of the controls
or the hierarchy of controls. Thus, a PHA that meets the regulatory requirements may inadequately
identify or mitigate major hazard risk. In addition, there is no requirement to submit PHAs to the
regulator, and the regulator is not responsible for assessing the quality of the PHA or the proposed
safeguards.
11

Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
10. The PSM standard does not effectively establish goals to prevent accidents or reduce risk. Only two
of the 14 elements (PHA and mechanical integrity) of the PSM standard contain some goal-setting
component.
11. In the last decade, the CSB has made a number of process-safety related recommendations to OSHA
and EPA in its investigation reports and studies (e.g. Motiva, BP Texas City, and Reactive Hazards).
However, none of the regulatory recommendations have been implemented, and there have been no
substantive changes made to the PSM and RMP regulations to improve the prevention of major accidents.
12. Available data from Norway and the United Kingdom (UK) shows a reduction in hydrocarbon
releases offshore under the safety case regulatory regime.22
13. Regulatory approaches similar to the safety case regulatory regime, which require risk reduction to
ALARP or equivalent, have been implemented in the nuclear sector by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) and the aerospace sector by NASA.
14. Independent studies of the safety case regulatory regime in the UK have identified improvements to
safety performance from the safety case and a variety of stakeholders, including major oil companies,
have shown support of the safety case.23
1.5 Regulatory Conclusions
The existing regulatory regimes for onshore petroleum refineries in the US and California:
1. Rely on a safety and environmental management system framework that is primarily activity-based
rather than requiring goal-based risk reduction to as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP) or
equivalent.
2. Are static, unable to adapt to innovation and advances in the management of major hazard risks.
3. Do not require that companies effectively manage the risks they create; nor do they require regulator
evaluation of the effectiveness of safeguards or regulator acceptance of companies’ plans for controlling
those risks.
4. Do not ensure continuous improvement by effectively incorporating lessons learned from major
accidents; nor do they require companies to address newly-identified safety issues as a result of such
incidents.
5. Do not effectively collect or promote industry use of major accident performance indicators to drive
industry to reduce risks to ALARP.
22 Norway’s indicator data is discussed in Section 4.5. The UK data is discussed in Appendix C.
23 See Sections 2.0, 3.2.1.2, and 3.2.2.3. Also see FAQ 4.
12

Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
6. Do not require the use or implementation of inherently safer systems analysis or hierarchy of controls.
7. Do not effectively involve the workforce in risk reduction and prevention of major accidents.
8. Do not provide the regulator with the authority to accept or reject a company’s hazard analysis, risk
assessment, or proposed safeguards; and
9. Do not employ the requisite number of staff with the technical skills, knowledge, and experience to
provide sufficient direct safety oversight of petroleum refineries.

2.0 Introduction
Despite the fact that the nation’s roughly 150 petroleum refineries represent only a small fraction of the
thousands of industrial and chemical facilities that exist in the US, the CSB has seen a great number of
serious and deadly incidents at refineries over the last decade.
In March 2005, the BP Texas City Refinery suffered one of the worst industrial accidents in recent US
history, when overfill of a distillation column resulted in an explosion and fire that led to 15 fatalities,
another 180 injuries, and the issuance of a shelter-in-place order that required 43,000 people to remain
indoors. Houses were damaged as far as three-quarters of a mile away from the refinery. In a 2006
statement, former CSB Chairwoman Carolyn Merritt said that while BP did make some safety
improvements before the March 2005 explosion, “the focus of many of these initiatives was on improving
procedural compliance and reducing occupational injury rates, while catastrophic safety risks
remained….”24
In November 2009, an explosion at the Silver Eagle Refinery damaged over 100 homes in a nearby
subdivision in Woods Cross, Utah. At a public meeting to discuss the incident, former CSB Chairman
John Bresland called on refineries to improve their safety performance, stating:
The frequency of accidents in US refineries is very troubling. These
accidents cost lives, inflict serious injuries and can harm communities.
They also earn scrutiny from government regulators; in the past few
weeks a refinery in Texas drew the largest OSHA fine in history, more
than US $80 million, for alleged process safety violations. I call on all
refineries to redouble their commitment to safer operations and safer
communities. The current rate of accidents in refineries is not
sustainable and it is not acceptable.25
On the five-year anniversary of the BP Texas City explosion in March 2010, Chairman Bresland
continued to relay his concern regarding refinery safety, noting that “refinery accidents…continue to
occur with dismaying frequency…[and] will only stop when every refinery has made the financial and
human commitment to sound process safety management.”26 Yet just ten days later, seven workers were
fatally injured at the Tesoro refinery in Anacortes, Washington, following the catastrophic failure of a
heat exchanger. Again, Chairman Bresland pointed out the alarming frequency of refinery incidents,
stating that “if the aviation industry had the same number and types of incidents as the refining industry, I
don’t think people would be flying too much.”27

On June 10, 2010, OSHA Deputy Assistant Secretary Jordan Barab testified before the Senate Committee
on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions’ Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety
regarding worker safety in US energy production industries. Mr. Barab noted that OSHA had counted
over 20 major incidents resulting in injuries or fatalities across the country that had occurred within the
last five years, including the Tesoro Anacortes explosion and fire in Washington. These incidents all
repeated a lesson that should have already been learned by the industry.28 According to Mr. Barab, “[t]his
cycle of workers being hurt or killed because their employers failed to implement well-known safety
measures points out major deficiencies in chemical process safety management in the nation’s refineries
and, quite possibly, to systemic safety and health problems in the entire petrochemical industry.”29
According to OSHA’s compliance instruction document CPL-03-00-00430 on the OSHA Petroleum
Process Safety Management National Emphasis Program (NEP) issued in 2007,
Since the PSM standard was promulgated by OSHA in 1992, no other
industry sector has had as many fatal or catastrophic incidents related to
the release of HHC [highly hazardous chemicals] as the petroleum
refining industry []. According to OSHA's IMIS [Integrated Management
Information System] database, since May 1992, 36 fatality/catastrophe
(FAT/CAT) incidents related to HHC releases in the refining industry
have occurred. These incidents included 52 employee deaths and 250
employee injuries, 98 of these injuries required hospitalization. The
number of refinery FAT/CAT incidents surpasses the combined total of
the next three highest industries over the same period (SIC 2899
Chemical Manufacturing, Not Elsewhere Classified (NEC) – 12
FAT/CATs; SIC 2869 Industrial Organic Chemical Manufacturing, NEC
– 12 FAT/CATs; and SIC 2892 Explosive Manufacturing – 11
FAT/CATs).31
In 2012 alone, the CSB tracked 125 significant32 process safety incidents at US petroleum refineries,
which are listed in Appendix A. Seventeen of these took place in California, including a major release of
8,614 pounds of highly toxic hydrogen sulfide at the Chevron Richmond Refinery on August 2, 2012, just
four days prior to the incident.
Of the 14 major accidents that the CSB is currently investigating, five occurred in petroleum refineries.
These include two separate explosions at the Silver Eagle refinery in Woods Cross, Utah, which resulted
in injuries and offsite consequences, and a series of equipment failures at CITGO’s refinery in Corpus
Christi, Texas, involving highly toxic hydrogen fluoride. In May 2014, the CSB released its final

investigation report on the heat exchanger rupture at the Tesoro refinery in Anacortes, Washington, which
resulted in seven fatalities. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has also documented 234
recordable accidents at petroleum refineries between 2000 and 2010. Despite the fact that the nation’s
petroleum refineries make up only roughly one percent of the some 13,000 facilities covered by the
EPA’s Risk Management Program, they accounted for more incidents in that time period than any other
industry, including the much larger sector of chemical manufacturing, which EPA documented as having
218 recordable accidents.33
The CSB concludes that the continuing occurrence of refinery accidents demonstrates the pressing need to
examine the current regulatory structure in place in the US and, in light of the Chevron incident, in the
state of California for petroleum refineries. There have been a number of positive developments in the
wake of the Chevron incident that demonstrate California’s prime opportunity to lead the nation in
implementing changes to improve safety and health in the refining industry. In the Fall of 2012 following
the Chevron incident, California Governor Jerry Brown created the California Interagency Working
Group on Refinery Safety (“the working group”), charged with improving cooperation among agencies,
including the EPA, Cal EPA, California’s Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA), and
Contra Costa County, with the goal of improving safety at California’s petroleum refineries and
preventing major accidents.
The working group began its initiative by commissioning the Labor Occupational Health Program34
(LOHP) to conduct “listening panels” throughout California, enabling community members to meet with
working group members to discuss their concerns surrounding refineries. LOHP convened a series of
meetings and conference calls with labor unions, community-based organizations, fire agencies, and
environmental health groups between November 6, 2012, and March 18, 2013. Dr. Michael P. Wilson,
the former Director of LOHP,35 documented his findings and recommendations regarding refinery safety
in a summary report entitled Refinery Safety in California: Labor, Community and Fire Agency Views,
which was released on June 4, 2013.36 In the report, Dr. Wilson quoted Swiss Re’s finding that the US
has experienced financial losses from refinery incidents that are three times that of industry counterparts
in countries within the “EU cluster,”37 a gap which continues to grow due in part to the US refining
industry’s “pushing…mode of operation”, its “compliance-driven focus on safety”, and “a ‘detached’
workforce….”38

Dr. Wilson reiterated a number of the findings contained in the CSB’s Interim Report on the Chevron
incident, including the “striking lack of attention on the part of the Richmond Chevron refinery to
maintenance and metallurgy upgrades…,” and the Chevron Richmond Refinery’s failure to implement a
recommended 100% component inspection program for high-risk piping. He also stated that California’s
refineries are able to operate without demonstrating competence in health, safety, and environmental
performance to a regulatory agency or to the public, and as such recommended that California establish a
regulatory approach similar to that of the safety case regulatory regime, a rigorous prescriptive39 and
goal-setting40 regulatory regime used widely by other regions throughout the world such as the United
Kingdom (UK) and Australia to regulate high hazard industrial facilities. It is highlighted by its
adaptability and requirements for continuous improvements in risk reduction, places the duty on industry
to demonstrate its competence in health and safety to the regulator. The regime is overseen by highly
competent, well-funded regulators that rigorously audit facilities for compliance with the written safety
case report and good industry practice.
On July 11, 2013, the working group released a draft report entitled Improving Public and Worker Safety
at Oil Refineries,41 which the CSB has recognized as an important step forward in improving petroleum
refinery safety and environmental performance both in California and nationally. The report outlined the
process of adopting several of the CSB‘s recommendations from its Interim Report on the Chevron
incident, including requiring refineries to implement inherently safer systems and conduct damage
mechanism hazard reviews. Furthermore, the report announced the creation of an Interagency Refinery
Task Force within the California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal/EPA) by September 1, 2013,
aimed at facilitating information sharing and improving coordination of oversight and enforcement
activities among regulatory agencies. The CSB welcomed the report’s recommendation for California to
study the safety case regulatory approach.
In addition to the work being done by the working group, the California State Legislature approved a
2013-2014 state budget bill (AP 110) that allows the California Department of Industrial Relations to
charge state petroleum refineries a “fee” by March 31, 2014, to help pay for at least 15 new positions in
Cal/OSHA’s Process Safety Unit, which enforces the California Process Safety Management (PSM)
standard throughout the state.42
The Chevron incident also spurred the formation of the City of Richmond’s Refinery Action
Collaborative (“the collaborative”), which was launched on January 30, 2013. The collaborative, whose

abatement and compliance. Performance or goal-based regulations, on the other hand, state the objective to be
obtained (such as risk reduction or hazard abatement) without describing the specific means of obtaining that
objective.

are specified and industry must document that their specific solutions meet such requirements, e.g. in terms of
acceptable risk levels.

members include the United Steelworkers43 (USW) Local 5, the USW International, Communities for a
Better Environment,44 and LOHP,45 was launched after a preliminary exploratory meeting held in October
2012. The collaborative advocates for community and worker safety, better transparency, and
environmental health, and has already made recommendations to the working group to improve emissions
reporting and require more thorough assessments of pipe corrosion damage at oil refineries.46
On October 10, 2013, the collaborative formally responded in a memo to the July 2013 draft report issued
by the Interagency Working Group on Refinery Safety (Improving Public and Worker Safety at Oil
Refineries). In the memo, the collaborative stated its support for the working group’s findings and
recommendations. The collaborative also issued its own recommendations and highlighted 12 principles
as being important to the development of effective regulatory policy in California. These principles
include linking regulatory non-compliance to an operator’s license to operate and integrating meaningful
participation in decision-making by workers and communities.47 The collaborative also noted in the
memo that it supported “shifting the ‘burden of proof’ of safety from public agencies to the industry, as is
required in the ‘Safety Case’ approach….”48
The CSB noted in its Chevron Interim Report the important role of transparency between industry and the
public in improving health and safety for the facility and the surrounding communities. Following the
Chevron incident the collaborative, worker representatives, regulators, and governmental bodies played a
key role in driving transparency, accountability, and improved risk reduction during the decision-making
process related to crude unit piping repairs. The CSB recommended to the California State Legislature in
the Interim Report to establish a multi-agency process safety regulatory program for all California
petroleum refineries to further improve public accountability and transparency by establishing a system to
report to the regulator methodologies, findings, conclusions, and corrective actions related to refinery
mechanical integrity inspection and repair work arising from California petroleum refinery PHAs,
turnarounds, and maintenance-related shutdowns.49 This system would require reporting of information
such as damage mechanism hazard reviews, establish procedures for greater workforce and public
participation, and provide mechanisms for federal, state, and local agency operational coordination,

sharing of data, and joint accident prevention activities. California is actively working to implement this
recommendation through the creation of the Interagency Refinery Task Force mentioned above.
It is also important to note that a growing dialogue has emerged throughout the US surrounding the need
to improve the regulation of hazardous materials and processes, to which the CSB has been an important
contributor. The CSB first examined the safety case in its 2002 investigation report entitled Improving
Reactive Hazard Management50 as a potentially effective alternative framework for the regulation of
reactive hazards. The CSB noted that successful implementation of this “comprehensive” regulatory
approach required a competent and experienced regulator. In December 2010, the CSB held a public
hearing in Washington, DC on the Regulatory Approaches to Offshore Oil and Gas Safety, where
internationally recognized experts in industrial safety and accident analysis provided important testimony
on managing risks offshore.51 Much of this testimony supported the implementation of the safety case as
a model for regulating major hazards, both onshore and off. For example, a Shell Oil Company
representative testified that the company had been using the safety case globally since 2002, and noted
that the most valuable aspect of that type of regulatory regime was the need to demonstrate that major
hazards have been managed using effective barriers52 and controls. In July 2012, the CSB held an
additional public hearing on Safety Performance Indicators.53 A number of international regulators
testified on the regulator’s ability under the safety case to drive continuous improvement in the oil and
gas industry. Finally, on July 25, 2013, the CSB held a public meeting to discuss the U.S. Occupational
Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA’s) failure to implement a number of key CSB safety
recommendations made to OSHA in the last decade to revise and improve its Process Safety Management
(PSM) standard and to issue a new combustible dust standard.
On January 18, 2011, President Obama issued Executive Order 13563,54 which called for improvements
in the nation’s regulatory system to promote predictability and reduce uncertainty and to use the best,
most innovative, and least burdensome tools for achieving regulatory ends. Specifically, it directed that
agencies review existing and proposed standards and regulations to ensure they effectively protect “public
health, welfare, safety, and our environment while promoting economic growth, innovation,
competitiveness, and job creation.”55 Finally, the order emphasized that to the extent feasible, regulations
and standards should specify performance objectives rather than the behavior or manner of compliance
that regulated entities must adopt, and be adopted through a process that involves public participation. As
a result of this Executive Order, OSHA, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE),

(PHMSA), and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) solicited views from the public and stakeholders regarding
opportunities to address improving efficiency and effectiveness of safety and environmental regulations
and standards in the oil and gas industry.56 These five agencies then convened an expert forum57 in
September 2012 in Texas City, Texas, to explore the benefits of implementing goal or performance-based
regulatory models such as the safety case in the oil and gas industry, and ways to advance the use of such
models in the US. The forum included a discussion of the safety case regulatory regime as a
performance-based regulatory model, and industrial safety and accident analysis expert Dr. Andrew
Hopkins spoke in support of that model.
In the wake of the April 2013 explosion and fire that occurred at a fertilizer storage and distribution
facility in West, Texas, and resulted in fifteen fatalities and hundreds of injuries, President Obama issued
Executive Order 1365058 on August 1, 2013. The Executive Order established the Chemical Facility
Safety and Security Working Group, a working group of federal agencies59 tasked with, among other
things, developing options for enhancing and modernizing policies, regulations, and standards to improve
the safety and security of chemical facilities.60 As will be discussed in Section 4.3, the group has
included the safety case regulatory model in a list of potential actions it may consider taking to improve
chemical safety regulation.61
The CSB has utilized a broad range of expert testimony and research to gain a comprehensive
understanding of regulatory models for onshore and offshore oil and gas facilities in countries around the
world, and, in light of this investigation, the state of California. This report highlights the significant
attributes of the safety case regime that together result in a more effective regulatory approach to process
safety and risk reduction. It also provides a detailed contrast of the safety case regulatory model to the
existing regulatory structures in the US and California, and makes recommendations to improve
California’s regulatory oversight of its petroleum refineries and to promote a broader national dialogue on
the safety case regulatory approach.

Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
3.0 The Safety Case Regulatory Regime
3.1 Introduction
Throughout modern history, major industrial accidents have been catalysts for significant regulatory
reform, as countries around the world strive to mitigate risk and improve the safety of their facilities and
processes in order to protect human health and the environment. According to industrial safety and
accident analysis expert Dr. Andrew Hopkins, “[d]isasters…offer an unparalleled opportunity to study the
workings of an organisation and to identify where things are going wrong.”62 Around the world, many of
these large-scale incidents have resulted in sweeping changes to legislation surrounding industrial safety
and health. These changes replace prescriptive, compliance-based regulations with goal-setting
regulations supplemented by prescriptive requirements that support adaptability, require duty holders63 to
demonstrate to the regulator that they have driven risks to as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP) or
equivalent, and provide the regulator with the tools to drive continuous improvement among major hazard
facilities.64 A majority of these regulatory regimes are referred to as the safety case, which Dr. Hopkins
defines as:
a case which the operator of a hazardous facility makes to the regulator,
setting out how safety is to be managed. It must include details of the
hazard identification process, the hazards which have been identified and
the procedures which have been set in place to control them. The system
remains self-regulatory in principle but rather than the facility being left
to its own devices by the regulator it must convince the regulator that its
strategy for managing safety is satisfactory [emphasis added]. Under
any safety case regime, facility operators are expected to adopt best
practice risk management.65
The safety case regulatory regime is much more than a written report; it shifts risk management
responsibility to the company and its employees and provides for rigorous review and oversight by a
technically competent regulator to ensure effective implementation.66

Australia, 1999; p 1.

The remaining portions of Section 3 will introduce major accidents that have occurred around the world
and discuss the history behind the global development and implementation of the safety case regulatory
approach on and offshore. Section 4.0 will then highlight major attributes of the safety case regulatory
approach. The US regulatory model will also be introduced and discussed throughout these sections to
allow for comparisons between the different approaches. Finally, Section 5.0 will discuss the regulation
of petroleum refineries in California specifically, including Chevron. The report concludes with
important recommendations focused on improving the regulatory oversight of California’s 14 refineries,
and encouraging OSHA, industry, labor, and others to work together to improve the regulation of
petroleum refineries throughout the US.
3.2 Initial Safety Case Implementation
3.2.1 United Kingdom
3.2.1.1 Onshore
Two major onshore incidents in the 1970s helped spark legislative reform focused on major accident
prevention and risk reduction for onshore major hazard facilities. A large dioxin67 release in Seveso,
Italy, in 1976, which injured hundreds of individuals, led the European Commission68 to adopt legislation
in 1982 known as the Seveso Directive, aimed at the prevention and control of major industrial
accidents.69 Following the 1984 toxic release in Bhopal, India, which resulted in several thousand known
fatalities, and the Sandoz chemical plant fire near Basel, Switzerland, which injured 14 individuals and
released nearly 30 tons of pesticides into the Rhine River, turning it red, the Seveso Directive was
amended and replaced in 1996 with the Seveso II Directive.70 The regulation requires owners or
operators of facilities that contain threshold quantities of listed substances to submit safety reports to a
competent authority (CA) within a Member State of the European Commission for its review and
acceptance.71 These reports must demonstrate to the CA that major-accident prevention policies, safety
management systems, and internal emergency plans have been created and implemented.72 The
current system. The Refinery NEP is a primary example of proactive inspections to verify compliance. It was
discontinued in 2011.
67 The term Dioxin refers to a family of toxic chemicals. They have been characterized by EPA as likely to be
human carcinogens and are anticipated to increase the risk of cancer at background levels of exposure. See
http://www.epa.gov/pbt/pubs/dioxins.htm (accessed June 17, 2013).
68 The European Commission consists of 27 Commissioners and “represents the interests of the EU [European
Union] as a whole. It proposes new legislation to the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union,
and it ensures that EU law is correctly applied by member countries.” http://ec.europa.eu/atwork/index_en.htm

70 The Seveso Directive was adopted in 1982 and was amended twice, in 1987 and 1988. On December 9, 1996, the
Seveso II Directive was adopted and replaced the original Seveso Directive. The Seveso III Directive was then
adopted on July 4, 2012, and became effective on August 13, 2012. Member States must implement Seveso III by
June 1, 2015. http://ec.europa.eu/environment/seveso/ (accessed May 6, 2013).

regulation also requires owners or operators to “prove to the competent authority…that he has taken all
measures necessary as specified in this Directive.”73
On June 1, 1974, the Flixborough Works of Nypro (UK)
Limited experienced a massive cyclohexane vapor cloud
explosion, killing 28 workers and injuring 36 workers
and hundreds of members of the public offsite. This
incident along with the Seveso incident led to the
Seveso Directive in 1982, and this was converted into
legislation in the United Kingdom (UK) via the Control
of Industrial Major Accident Hazards (CIMAH) 1984
Regulations. The Control of Major Accidents74 Hazards
Regulations (COMAH) replaced CIMAH in April 1999
to conform to the updated Seveso II Directive. The
Health and Safety Executive75 (HSE), the Environment
Agency76 (EA), and the Scottish Environmental
Protection Agency77 (SEPA) are considered to be the
UK’s CA responsible for the enforcement of these
regulations. A key feature differentiating these two
regulations is the increasing emphasis from the operator
having to “describe” the safety systems in CIMAH to
being required to “demonstrate” their adequacy in
COMAH.78

74 The COMAH regulations define “major accident” as “an occurrence (including in particular, a major emission,
fire or explosion) resulting from uncontrolled developments in the course of the operation of any establishment and
leading to serious danger to human health or the environment, immediate or delayed, inside or outside the
establishment, and involving one or more dangerous substances…” COMAH Regulations, Part 1, Regulation 2

across Great Britain’s workplaces.” See http://www.hse.gov.uk/aboutus/ (accessed May 7, 2013). According to the
HSE’s Enforcement Policy Statement, the HSE’s purpose is “to protect the health, safety and welfare of people at
work, and to safeguard others, mainly members of the public, who may be exposed to risks from the way work is
carried out.” http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/hse41.pdf (accessed May 7, 2013).

The COMAH regulations apply to all onshore facilities that have sufficient quantities of dangerous
substances as listed in Schedule 179 of the regulations.80 The general duty for all duty holders of facilities
covered under the COMAH regulations is to “take all measures necessary to prevent major accidents and
limit their consequences to people and the environment.”81 The HSE interprets this duty as the equivalent
of reducing risks82 to “as low as reasonably practicable,” or ALARP.83,84,85 Duty holders are required to
prepare a safety report that “demonstrate[s] to the CA that all measures necessary for the prevention and
mitigation of major accidents have been taken.”86 These reports must contain information for the CA to
review and analyze, including a policy on preventing and mitigating major accidents; a management
system for implementing that policy that complies with good practice;87 an effective method for
identifying any major accidents that might occur; and measures to prevent and mitigate major accidents.88
To assist operators with reducing risks to ALARP, the HSE publishes guidance documents that contain
good practice guidelines and standards and that discuss what constitutes good practice.89

Health and Safety at Work etc. Act, Part I, Section 2 (1) and (2) (1974). HSE has interpreted that SFAIRP duties
call for the same set of tests to be applied as duties to reduce risks “as low as reasonably practicable,” or ALARP.
According to HSE, “”the two terms mean essentially the same thing and at their core is the concept of ‘reasonably
practicable’;…” See http://www.hse.gov.uk/risk/theory/alarpglance.htm (accessed May 7, 2013).
85 According to HSE, the concept of “reasonably practicable” “involves weighing a risk against the trouble, time and
money needed to control it. Thus, ALARP describes the level to which [they] expect to see workplace risks
controlled.” This allows HSE to “set goals for duty-holders, rather than being prescriptive; HSE’s policy is that any
proposed regulatory action should be based on what is reasonably practicable.” According to HSE, in most
situations, deciding whether the risks are ALARP involves a “comparison between the control measures a duty-
holder has in place or is proposing and the measures [they] would normally expect to see in such circumstances i.e.
relevant good practice. ‘Good practice’ is defined as ‘those standards for controlling risk that HSE has judged and
recognized as satisfying the law, when applied to a particular relevant case, in an appropriate manner.’… Once what
is good practice has been determined, much of the discussion with duty-holders about whether a risk is or will be
ALARP is likely to be concerned with the relevance of the good practice, and how appropriately it has been (or will
be) implemented.” See http://www.hse.gov.uk/risk/theory/alarpglance.htm (accessed May 7, 2013).

3.2.1.2 Offshore
The international offshore energy sector experienced several catastrophic incidents in the 1980s,
including the Alexander Kielland 90 incident in Norway in 1980 which resulted in 123 fatalities, and the
Piper Alpha91 incident in the UK in 1988, which fatally injured 167 workers. These incidents initiated
offshore regulatory changes focused on risk reduction and control that were modeled after the CIMAH
regulations.
Following the Piper Alpha incident, the UK Secretary of State for the Department of Energy ordered that
a public inquiry be held to determine the circumstances surrounding the incident.92 The Secretary
directed Lord Cullen, a Senator of the College of Justice in Scotland, to hold the inquiry and report to the
Secretary “the circumstances of the accident and its cause together with any observations and
recommendations which he thinks fit to make with a view to the preservation of life and the avoidance of
similar accidents in the future.”93
The result was The Public Inquiry into the Piper Alpha Disaster (“the Cullen Report”), an extensive
report released in October 1990. The report called into question the adequacy of the detailed prescriptive
regulatory regime that existed at the time of the incident94 for offshore oil and gas operations, and listed
106 recommendations to revamp offshore safety regulation in the UK, 57 of which the HSE was
responsible for overseeing.95
The Cullen Report found that the operating company (Occidental Petroleum, a US company), “did not
possess any system which ensured that such remote, but potentially disastrous, events were subjected to
systematic scrutiny…[and] there was for major projects no comprehensive system of safety assessment
and management did not appear to appreciate fully the contribution which it could make.”96 The report
noted that there was a need for a formal safety assessment (FSA), “an assessment essentially equivalent to
the Safety Case,”97 which “involves the identification and assessment of hazards over the whole life cycle
of a project…[because]…the combinations of potential hardware and human failures are so numerous that
a major accident hardly ever repeats itself…[and] [a] strategy for risk management must [] address the
entire spectrum of possibilities.”98
90 The Alexander Kielland was a flotel for housing workers. A total of 212 people were on board when it capsized
near the Edda platform in the Ekofisk area of the North Sea on March 27, 1980. As a result of this incident, 123
individuals lost their lives and only 89 survived.
91 On July 6, 1988, an explosion occurred aboard the Piper Alpha oil production platform 120 miles off the coast of
Scotland in the North Sea. A series of explosions and fire killed 167 workers and almost completed destroyed the
platform. This incident became the deadliest accident in the history of the offshore industry.

Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
In his analysis, Lord Cullen noted that the current offshore regulations were prescriptive in nature rather
than goal-setting, and that this had the effect of hampering operators’ flexibility and stifling innovation.99
He stated that “one of the reasons for adopting the goal-setting approach was to make regulations that
were more flexible, so that changing technology could be accommodated without the need for new
legislation.”100 Lord Cullen pointed to the CIMAH Regulations, discussed above, as a forward-looking
regulatory model, which required onshore major hazard installation operators to “provide HSE with a
written report on the safety of the installation…commonly called the Safety Case.”101 Lord Cullen noted
that the safety case “is a means by which an operator demonstrates to itself the safety of its
activities…[and] also serves as the basis for the regulation of major hazard activities.”102
Lord Cullen concluded that an FSA “is an essential element in a modern safety regime for major hazard
installations…that this FSA should take the form of a Safety Case…[and that] [t]he regime should have
as its central feature demonstration of safe operation by the operator.”103 He recommended that a safety
case regulatory regime be implemented offshore for both fixed and mobile installations as it already was
for onshore major hazard installations, that it be complemented by other regulations dealing with specific
features, that the safety case contain goal-setting regulations, and that it be part of a continuing dialogue
between the operator and the regulatory body.104
Lord Cullen recommended the implementation of safety regulations requiring the owner or operator of
every fixed and mobile installation operating in UK waters to submit a safety case to HSE. In response,
the UK established the Offshore Installations (Safety Case) Regulations in 1992.105 The primary goal of
these Regulations was “to reduce the risks from major accident hazards to the health and safety of the
workforce employed on offshore installations or in connected activities.”106
Oil & Gas UK, 107 the main UK offshore oil industry trade association whose members include the major
oil companies that operate in the Gulf of Mexico (such Shell and Exxon), has expressed strong support for
the safety case regime. In its response to the European Commission’s published draft legislative
proposals to modify offshore safety case regulations, Oil & Gas UK noted that those proposals would
undermine the “proactive, flexible and responsive approach to managing risks, borne out of the lessons
learnt from Piper Alpha as well as the evolving nature of the offshore oil and gas business itself.”108 In
the wake of the Macondo incident in the Gulf of Mexico, the UK government directed Professor Geoffrey

3.2.2 Global Analysis of Safety Case Implementation
3.2.2.1 Australia
3.2.2.1.1 Offshore
Following the Piper Alpha disaster in 1988, the then Australian Commonwealth Minister for Resources at
the time, Senator Peter Cook, formed a Consultative Committee on Safety in the Offshore Petroleum
Industry to advise him on safety issues surrounding offshore operations in Australia. In 1991, the
Committee released its Report of the Consultative Committee on Safety in the Offshore Petroleum
Industry.112 In the report, the Committee examined the circumstances, causes, and recommendations
described in both the Cullen Report and Esso Australia’s113 investigation report on a fire that occurred on
the Tuna platform in April 1989 in Bass Strait that injured four individuals. The Committee noted that
while there were many differences between the two incidents, they “both demonstrated the need for
greater attention to the management of safety in a number of areas of offshore operations.”114 They
pointed to the safety case as an important regulatory concept that should be applied to oil and gas
operations in Australian waters, and concluded by recommending that the safety case concept described
by Lord Cullen and carried out onshore by the Seveso Directive and CIMAH regulations be adopted for
Australian offshore petroleum operations.115 It would “require the operator of a facility to formally
document how safety is to be managed within the facility, [and] [] demonstrate that the major hazards of
the installation have been identified and appropriate controls provided…”116 The Committee also
recommended the implementation of both prescriptive and “objective” regulations.117 At that time,
offshore petroleum safety was the joint responsibility of the Commonwealth and the States/Northern
Territory. Following this inquiry, new Commonwealth regulations were created: for example, Schedule

8 on “Occupational Health and Safety” was added to the Petroleum Submerged Lands Act (PSLA) in
1992 to require safety cases to be developed for all offshore petroleum facilities.
The Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Safety) Regulations 2009 set out the requirements
for the contents of offshore safety cases. The operator of an offshore petroleum facility must submit a
safety case for review and acceptance to the Australian National Offshore Petroleum Safety and
Environmental Management Authority (NOPSEMA), the Australian Commonwealth Statutory Agency
charged with regulating the health and safety, structural integrity, and environmental management of all
offshore petroleum facilities in Australian Commonwealth waters, and in coastal waters where State
powers have been reduced. NOPSEMA accepts a safety case “if it is satisfied that the arrangements set
out in the document demonstrate that the risks will be reduced to…ALARP.”118
3.2.2.1.2 Onshore
In 1998, Esso Australia’s gas plant at Longford in Victoria suffered a major release and fire caused by
cold temperature embrittlement due to a process upset and lack of engineering support for diagnosis,
which resulted in two fatalities, eight additional injuries, and cut the State of Victoria’s gas supply for two
weeks causing major industrial disruption and workforce stand downs. While the safety case at this time
was required for offshore operations in Australia, onshore facilities like the Longford plant were subject
only to prescriptive provisions contained within the Victoria Occupational Health and Safety Act 1985.
In its report on the incident, the Royal Commission concluded that all major hazard facilities in Victoria
should be required to develop and submit a safety case to the appropriate regulatory authority. In 1996,
Australia’s National Occupational Health and Safety Commission119 (NOHSC) recommended the safety
case be adopted for all major onshore hazard facilities in Australia, and in 2002 NOHSC established a
National Standard for the Control of Major Hazard Facilities and a National Code of Practice for the
Control of Major Hazard Facilities.120 The Standard states that operators of major hazard facilities “shall
provide the relevant public authority with a safety report…” that, among other things, identifies the type,
relative likelihood and consequences of major accidents that might occur, and provides details of the
safety management system (SMS) for that facility.121 In addition, operators of major hazard facilities
must identify all major hazards and the risks associated with those hazards, and minimize each risk “so far
as practicable.”122
118 See http://www.nopsema.gov.au/safety/safety-case/what-is-a-safety-case/ (accessed July 15, 2013).
119 In 1985 The National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (NOHSC) was established as a tripartite body
to develop, facilitate and implement a unified national approach to occupational health and safety in Australia. On
January 1, 2006, NOHSC was replaced by the Australian Safety and Compensation Council (ASCC). On March 31,
2009, the ASCC was abolished and replaced with Safe Work Australia. Safe Work Australia was established by the
Safe Work Australia Act 2008 with the authority to help develop policy to improve worker health, safety, and
compensation across Australia. It does not regulate work health and safety laws; rather it develops national policy.

According to the Australian Safety and Compensation Council’s 2004 Annual Situation Report for the
National Standard for the Control of Major Hazard Facilities, all Australian jurisdictions were expected
to have the standard in place before the end of 2005, roughly three years after its inception.123
3.2.2.2 Norway
Following the capsizing of the Alexander Kielland in 1980, Norway moved in a direction similar to the
European Commission and developed performance-based regulations focused on major accident
prevention. Although the country did not adopt the safety case regulatory regime per se, the current
regulatory approach implements many similar elements.
Currently in Norway, the Petroleum Safety Authority124 (PSA) regulates safety for activities at onshore
and offshore major hazard facilities, and requires the responsible party125 to reduce risk “to the extent
possible,” and “select technical, operational and organisational solutions that reduce the probability that
harm, errors and hazard and accident situations occur.”126 This concept is akin to ALARP whereby
companies choose the solutions and barriers that have the greatest risk-reducing effect, provided the costs
are not significantly disproportionate to the risk reduction achieved.127 However, unlike the UK and
Australia, PSA regulations do not require the submission of a safety case report by the operator of a
facility, although facilities are still expected to develop them and make them available to the regulator
upon request for auditing purposes. Rather, PSA “supervises” industry, as explained in the following:
Supervision involves much more than audits offshore or on land. It
embraces the total contact between the regulator and the regulated. It
covers everything which gives the PSA the necessary basis to determine
whether the companies are accepting their responsibility to operate
acceptably in all phases. Supervisory activities include investigations,
considering consent applications and meetings with the industry.128
As will be discussed below, because the safety case regulatory approach requires the regulator to conduct
detailed assessments of safety case reports and auditing of facilities against the safety case, its
implementation requires substantial funding to support and maintain a sufficient number of highly
experienced and competent staff.

3.2.2.3 The United States
Despite the international shift to the safety case regime and even though major oil companies that operate
both onshore and offshore in the US also operate globally under safety case regimes and have shown
support for the safety case,129 the US has persisted in the use of a more activity-based regulatory scheme
that does not contain a specific risk reduction target and that lacks the ability to adapt to advancing
technology and recently developed industry standards. Due to the major potential hazards present in
onshore and offshore oil and gas operations, these sectors should have in place adaptable safety regimes
that adequately engage companies and their employees in continuous improvement and risk reduction.
As the CSB has devoted extensive time and resources to studying and analyzing the regulation of offshore
oil and gas facilities in the US as a result of its Macondo incident investigation, this report will focus on
the regulation of onshore oil and gas operations in the US and California.
On October 23, 1989, a massive explosion and fire occurred at the Phillips 66 Company’s Houston
Chemical Complex in Pasadena, Texas, resulting in 23 fatalities and injuring more than 130. In response,
the U.S. Department of Labor issued a report to the President and declared, among other things, that the
U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) would “expedite completion of its
rulemaking requiring employers to implement comprehensive chemical process safety management plans
for hazardous chemical processes.”130 Sparked by a number of serious accidents, including the Phillips
66 incident and the 1984 toxic release in Bhopal, India, which resulted in several thousand known
fatalities, OSHA published in the Federal Register (55 FR 29150) on July 17, 1990, a proposed standard
containing requirements for the management of hazards associated with processes using highly hazardous
chemicals.131 Soon after, Congress adopted the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments (CAAA) of 1990,
129A Shell Oil Company representative testified at the CSB December 2010 public meeting on the safety case that
the company had been using the safety case globally since 2002, and noted that the most valuable aspect of that type
of regulatory regime was the need to demonstrate that major hazards have been managed using effective barriers and
controls. Shell Geelong Refinery Plant Manager Huck Poh has stated, “As a Major Hazard Facility, Shell Geelong
Refinery and Lara Terminal is required to submit a Safety Case for assessment by Safe Work Victoria. This
document is a summary of that Safety Case and explains the potential impact of the facility on our neighbours and
the community. We take a systematic approach to managing safety and preventing incidents that place our people,
our neighbours, the Geelong community, the environment and our facilities at risk. This is reflected in our Safety
Management System and the approach that has been undertaken for the development and review of the Safety Case.
Shell is committed to achieving continuous Health, Safety, Security and Environment (HSSE) performance
improvement. There are ongoing review and revision activities to ensure our analyses remain relevant and reflect
the current status of operations and our risk reduction measures are consistent with latest industry practice. This
commitment to continuous improvement is reflected in the Shell HSSE Policy and supported by our HSSE results.”

Safety Case is a systematic and comprehensive review of our operations and processes which includes the
identification of potential major incidents that could occur, assesses the risks associated with these major incidents
and demonstrates the controls we have in place to manage these risks to as low as reasonably practicable.” See

Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
which resulted in the creation of the CSB and authorized the first federal regulations specifically designed
to prevent major chemical accidents that threaten workers, the public, and the environment: OSHA’s
Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s)
Risk Management Program.
3.2.2.3.1 OSHA PSM Standard
Section 304 of the CAAA mandated that OSHA develop “a chemical process safety standard designed to
protect employees from hazards associated with accidental release of highly hazardous chemicals in the
workplace.”132 OSHA responded by adopting 29 CFR §1910.119 Process Safety Management of Highly
Hazardous Chemicals (“the PSM standard”) in 1992. The PSM standard applies to a process133 involving
a chemical at or above the listed threshold quantity (also known as a highly hazardous chemical), or
flammables in a quantity of 10,000 pounds or more.134 It contains 14 elements with broad requirements
to implement management systems, identify and control hazards, and prevent “catastrophic releases of
highly hazardous chemicals.” While the PSM standard was intended to be performance-based and does
contain some goal-setting elements, a majority of the standard is activity-based, and there is no general
duty requirement under the PSM standard to reduce risks to a certain extent or prevent catastrophic
accidents. As will be discussed at length in Section 4.3, the PSM standard has essentially remained
stagnant since its inception in 1992. According to the Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS), the
PSM standard has resulted “in a minimum cost, compliance-based approach to managing process safety…
‘If [it] isn’t a regulatory requirement, I’m not going to do it!’”135
A key provision of the PSM standard is the process hazard analysis (PHA) of covered processes. 136
PHA requirements include a review of the process to identify, evaluate, and control the hazards, and an
evaluation of the consequences of failure of those controls.137,138 The PHA required by the OSHA PSM
standard is an example of a goal-setting requirement in that it allows for a variety of hazard analysis
methodologies to be performed to satisfy the requirement. However, the element is activity-based in that
completing a PHA for each covered process and updating it at least every five years is satisfactory. The
regulator is not responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of controls or safeguards, and there is no
requirement to reduce risks to a certain extent such as ALARP. Thus, the resulting PHA that meets the
132 Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Section 304(a). November 5, 1990. See
http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/caaa.txt (accessed May 10, 2013).
133 The PSM standard defines “process” as “any activity involving a highly hazardous chemical including any use,
storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.”
29 CFR §1910.119(b) (1992).
134 29 CFR §1910.119(a)(1) (1992). This standard also applies to the manufacture of explosives and pyrotechnics in
any quantity [29 CFR §1910.109(k)(2) & (3)].
135 CCPS. Guidelines for Risk Based Process Safety. 2007; p 2.
136 A Process hazard analysis is a thorough, orderly, systematic approach for identifying, evaluating, and controlling
hazards of processes involving highly hazardous chemicals. The employer must perform an initial process hazard
analysis on all processes covered by the PSM standard and all process hazard analyses must be updated and
revalidated, based on their completion date, every five years. See
http://www.osha.gov/doc/outreachtraining/htmlfiles/psm.html (accessed May 10, 2013).
137 29 CFR §1910.119(e) (1992).
138 The other elements of the PSM standard are process safety information, operating procedures, employee
participation, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, hot work permits,
management of change, incident investigation, emergency planning and response, and compliance audits. The 14th
“element” is mainly a requirement that maintaining trade secrecy not interfere with an employer’s compliance with
the other 13 elements.
31

Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
regulatory requirements of “controlling” hazards may actually inadequately identify or mitigate the
hazards. In addition, there is no requirement for employers to submit their PHAs to the regulator for
review. In most cases, this means the regulator will not review these PHAs until there is a significant
process accident, a complaint, or a (rare) planned inspection.
Another key element of the PSM standard, the Management of Change (MOC) provision, requires the
development of written procedures “to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, and
procedures…”139 The procedures must consider, among other things, the technical basis for a proposed
change and its potential impact on safety and health.140 Historically, the MOC requirement has been
treated and enforced as an activity-based requirement as well. For example, when the BP Texas City
refinery explosion and fire occurred on March 23, 2005, all 15 fatalities and many of the 180 injuries
occurred in or around nine contractor trailers that were sited near process areas and as close as 121 feet to
the isomerization (ISOM) unit where the incident occurred. The refinery had been using trailers as
temporary office spaces for several years. The refinery addressed facility siting for trailers during its
2004 MOC for an upcoming 2005 turnaround. The MOC form indicated that a double-wide mobile office
trailer would be temporarily sited in the open area between the ISOM and naphtha desulfurization units
(NDU) for use during the upcoming turnaround, to be removed at the end of April 2005. However, the
MOC did not analyze siting hazards; rather the MOC team attached a drawing showing the proposed
interior configuration of the trailer and measured its location from the catalyst warehouse.141 In early
2005, eight other trailers were sited between the ISOM and NDU without even conducting an MOC. The
CSB pointed out in its Urgent Recommendations stemming from the Texas City incident that these
trailers could have been easily relocated to less hazardous sites, and BP did so following the incident.142
Despite this fact, BP’s siting policy considered that utilizing trailers in this way posed little or no danger
to occupants, which conformed with the American Petroleum Institute’s (API) Recommended Practice
(RP) 752, Management of Hazards Associated with Location of Process Plant Buildings.
Although the MOC failed to identify or analyze hazards stemming from siting trailers so close to process
areas, OSHA did not cite BP for conducting a poor MOC following the incident, as merely completing
the MOC satisfied the requirements of the PSM standard. As it would have been very practical to move
the trailers to a safer location, a regulator under the safety case regulatory regime would have the ability
to require BP to do just that to reduce risks to ALARP.
The OSHA PSM standard includes requirements for two of its 14 elements – mechanical integrity and
process safety information (PSI) – to comply with recognized and generally accepted good engineering
practices, or RAGAGEP.143 RAGAGEPs are technologically focused, with no emphasis on
139 29 CFR §1910.119(l)(1) (1992).
140 Id at (l)(2)(i) and (ii) (1992).
141 To learn more about the PHA and MOC processes relating to the BP Texas City Refinery, see the CSB BP Texas

142 See CSB Urgent Trailer Siting Recommendations at http://www.csb.gov/assets/1/19/BP_Recs_2.pdf (accessed

143 RAGAGEPs “are engineering, operation, or maintenance activities based on established codes, standards,
published technical reports or recommended practices (RP) or a similar document. RAGAGEPs detail generally
approved ways to perform specific engineering, inspection or mechanical integrity activities, such as fabricating a
32

Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
organizational, human factors, or culture-based measures. OSHA developed the mechanical integrity
RAGAGEP requirement to “make sure that process equipment is inspected and tested properly, and that
the inspections and tests are performed in accordance with appropriate codes and standards.”144 OSHA
has recognized a number of practices, guidelines, and standards as RAGAGEPs, including the American
Society of Civil Engineers, Design of Blast Resistant Buildings in Petrochemical Facilities, the
Department of Defense, TMS-1300 Structures to Resist the Effects of Accidental Explosions, and the
American Petroleum Institute (API) Recommended Practice (RP) 520: Sizing, Selection, and Installation
of Pressure-Relieving Devices in Refineries.145 Unlike other regulators such as the HSE, OSHA has not
compiled a comprehensive list of good practices, or RAGAGEPs, for companies to utilize during
operations, and the CSB has only identified two OSHA Letters of Interpretation regarding
implementation of RAGAGEP in PSM. According to CCPS, “[o]rganizations lack a thorough
understanding of recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices and are inconsistent in
interpreting and applying them.”146 In addition, key PSM elements such as PHA, incident investigation,
and MOC do not reference RAGAGEP, and have not kept up to date with good practice guidelines,
including CCPS’ Guidelines for Risk Based Process Safety, which addresses 20 PSM elements for
process safety, including human factors, workforce involvement, and safety culture.
Historically, OSHA has primarily enforced147 RAGAGEP reactively, and may cite companies for
violations of RAGAGEPs following an incident. For example, following the BP Texas City Refinery
incident, OSHA issued BP hundreds of citations, some of which covered BP’s willful violations of API
520 and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, both
considered by OSHA to be RAGAGEPs. Following the Chevron incident, California’s Division of
Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) issued Chevron two willful citations for allegedly not
complying with API RP 939-C, Guidelines for Avoiding Sulfidation (Sulfidic) Corrosion Failures in Oil
Refineries and Chevron’s own internal corrosion mitigation plan as RAGAGEPs (this will be discussed in
greater detail in Section 5.1.2.2).
3.2.2.3.2 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Program
Section 301(r) of the CAAA called for EPA to develop regulations related to the prevention and detection
of accidental releases for regulated substances, including requiring owners or operators of stationary
sources that have regulated substances present to prepare and implement a “risk management plan to
vessel, inspecting a storage tank, or servicing a relief valve.” OSHA Instruction CPL 03-00-004. June 7, 2007.

detect and prevent or minimize accidental releases of such substances from the stationary source.…”148
The risk management plan would require a “hazard assessment to assess the potential effects of an
accidental release of any regulated substance.”149 In 1996, EPA promulgated the Risk Management
Program regulations at 40 CFR Part 68, which went into effect in 1999.
The EPA’s Risk Management Program requires facilities that contain more than the threshold quantity of
any of the 77 listed toxic chemicals or 63 flammable substances150 to prepare and submit to the regulating
agency emergency contact information, descriptions of processes and hazardous chemicals onsite, an
accident history, and worst-case release scenarios.151 The regulation defines three different Program
levels (Program 1, 2, or 3) based on a process unit’s potential for impact to the public and the
requirements to prevent accidents.152 Program 3 processes are subject to additional, more stringent
requirements to prevent accidents similar to those of the OSHA PSM standard. Program 3 facilities must
implement elements of a prevention program, including: process safety information (PSI), PHA, standard
operating procedures (SOPs), training, mechanical integrity, compliance audits, incident investigations,
MOC, pre-startup reviews, employee participation, and hot work permits. These prevention program
elements are based primarily on the OSHA PSM standard, and much of the language contained in each
element is identical to the PSM standard. As such, the Risk Management Program regulations contain the
same RAGAGEP requirements for mechanical integrity and PSI as the OSHA PSM standard for covered
facilities. For example, 40 CFR §68.48 requires an owner or operator to “ensure that the process is
designed in compliance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices
[RAGAGEP].”153 Like OSHA, the EPA is able to cite facilities for failure to comply with RAGAGEP
following an incident, but does not maintain a list of RAGAGEPs for reference.
Finally, each covered facility must submit a risk management plan (RMP) to EPA for all covered
processes154 and update and resubmit these plans at least once every five years, or whenever a major
accident occurs or the emergency contact information changes. Completing and submitting the RMP
satisfies the regulatory requirement; again, the effectiveness of the RMP in risk reduction is not assessed
by the EPA, rendering this another activity-based requirement for a covered facility. There is no approval
of the RMP by the EPA, and there is no additional duty on the facility to implement what it says it is
doing in the RMP, unlike the safety case regulatory regime.
Any facility with one or more covered processes must include in its RMP an executive summary; the
registration for the facility; the certification statement; a worst-case scenario for each process involving
flammables or toxics; the five-year accident history for each process; information concerning emergency

response at the facility; at least one alternative release scenario analysis for each regulated toxic substance
or flammable; a summary of the prevention program for each Program 2 process; and a summary of the
prevention program for each Program 3 process.155
The CSB found in its BP Texas City Investigation Report that as of March 2007, the RMP regulation had
focused primarily on reviewing the submitted RMPs and required updates by covered facilities. The EPA
Office of Inspector General (OIG) concluded in 2009 that over half of the RMP-covered facilities
identified in the US as high-risk156 had never received an on-site inspection or audit, and over 65 percent
of all active RMP facilities had not received an on-site inspection or audit since inception of the RMP
program in 1999.157 The EPA OIG also noted that of the 296 uninspected high-risk facilities regulated by
the EPA, 151 of these could each impact 100,000 people or more in a worst-case accident scenario.158
3.2.2.3.3 Safety Case in the United States
In contrast to its mainly activity-based regulation of hazardous
chemicals, including oil and gas operations, the US has adopted a
more goal-based regulatory approach for its nuclear and
aeronautics and space science sectors. The U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC) was an early adopter of goal or
performance-based regulation, which it defines as “[a] regulatory
approach that focuses on desired, measureable outcomes, rather
than prescriptive processes, techniques, or procedures…[and] leads
to defined results without specific direction regarding how those
results are to be obtained.”159 According to the NRC,
performance-based regulations permit licensees to “have flexibility
to determine how to meet the established performance criteria in ways that encourage and reward
improved outcomes.”160 The NRC’s Reactor Oversight Process, the means by which it achieves its
mission of public health and safety in commercial nuclear power plant operations, is its primary

Chemical Accident Prevention (40 CFR Part 68); March 2009; pp 9-1 and 9-2. See
http://www.epa.gov/osweroe1/docs/chem/Toc_final.pdf (accessed May 14, 2013).
156 A high-risk facility is one that meets one of more of the following characteristics established by the EPA Office
of Emergency Management: 1) Facilities whose reported RMP worst-case scenario population exceeds 100,000
people; 2) Any RMP Program facility with a hazard index greater than or equal to 25; and/or 3) Facilities that have
had one or more significant accidental releases within the previous five years. See “EPA Office of Inspector
General, “Improvements Needed in EPA Training and Oversight for Risk Management Program Inspections.”

performance-based regulation.161 It uses seven “cornerstones,” such as mitigating systems and barrier
integrity, to monitor three performance areas (reactor safety, radiation safety, and security safeguards).162
Licensee performance data, inspection plans, quarterly assessments, and assessment and inspection
responses are tied to each performance area and several cross-cutting objectives, such as worker
involvement and human performance.163 Licensees are permitted to choose the precise methods they use
to meet overarching performance goals, which are guided by their duty to reduce risks to as low as
reasonably achievable, or ALARA.164,165 The NRC has stated that this flexibility is one of the main
reasons that its regulatory philosophy encourages continuous improvement.166
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has the goal of implementing a safety
system that is “as safe as reasonably practicable,” or ASARP,167 which it considers to be closely related to
ALARP. NASA relies on a risk-informed safety case, or RISC,168 to ensure that the system’s safety
objectives, goals, and thresholds have been achieved, and that safety risk is as low as possible within
reasonable impacts on cost, schedule, and performance.169

165 ALARA “means making every reasonable effort to maintain exposures to radiation as far below the dose limits
in this part as is practical consistent with the purpose for which the licensed activity is undertaken, taking into
account the state of technology, the economics of improvements in relation to state of technology, the economics of
improvements in relation to benefits to the public health and safety, and other societal and socioeconomic
considerations, and in relation to utilization of nuclear energy and licensed materials in the public interest.” 10 CFR

167 NASA defines ASARP as “a fundamental principle of adequate safety. A determination that a system is ASARP
entails weighing its safety performance against the sacrifice needed to further improve it. The system is ASARP if
an incremental improvement in safety would require a disproportionate deterioration of system performance in other
areas.” NASA/SP-2010-580, NASA System Safety Handbook, Volume 1, System Safety Framework and Concepts
for Implementation; November 2011; p 5.

168 NASA defines RISC as “a structured argument, supported by a body of evidence that provides a compelling,
comprehensive and valid case that a system is or will be adequately safe for a given application in a given
environment. This is accomplished by addressing each of the operational safety objectives that have been negotiated
for the system, including articulation of a roadmap for the achievement of safety objectives that are applicable to
later phases of the system life cycle. The term ‘risk-informed’ is used to emphasize that a determination of adequate
safety is the result of a deliberative decision making process that necessarily entails an assessment of risks and tries
to achieve a balance between the system’s safety performance and its performance in other areas.” Ibid at 13.

4.0 Key Features of an Effective Safety Case Regulatory Regime
Following the Macondo disaster, the National Commission on the Macondo Oil Spill and Offshore
Drilling170 made a recommendation in its Report to the President171 for the US to “develop a proactive,
risk-based performance approach specific to individual facilities, operations and environments, similar to
the ‘safety case’ approach in North Sea.”172 Despite the major potential hazards that are present in both
onshore and offshore oil and gas operations, the safety case regime has not been implemented in the US
for either sector. The US has instead implemented for major hazards at onshore facilities a more activity-
based approach, resulting in static regulations such as the PSM and RMP regulations that have not seen
significant improvements173 since their inception, despite advances in technology and good industry
practice.
According to Dr. Hopkins and other renowned experts in the field, it is essential for an effective major
accident prevention safety regime to take the form of a safety case, with adaptable goal-setting regulations
that facilitate innovation and sustainability, and that drive industry to continuously improve and reduce
risks to ALARP. To accomplish this, the regime must utilize sufficient numbers of highly competent
personnel to effectively collect or promote industry use of process safety indicators174 and to provide
knowledgeable oversight of industry operations.
The CSB has determined that there are several key features of an effective major accident prevention
regulatory approach such as the safety case regime:
• Duty Holder Safety Responsibility, including a Written Case for Safety
• Continuous Risk Reduction to ALARP
• Adaptability and Continuous Improvement
• Active Workforce Participation
• Process Safety Indicators that Drive Performance
• Regulatory Assessment, Verification, and Intervention; and an
• Independent, Competent, Well-Funded Regulator
As will be discussed in Section 5, California’s patchwork of regulations does not effectively implement
these features, which are also illustrated in the figure below. Section 4 provides a detailed discussion of
these features.
170 President Barack Obama established the National Commission on the BP Macondo Oil Spill and Offshore
Drilling through Executive Order 13543 on May 21, 2010, to examine the facts and circumstances concerning the
root causes of the Macondo explosion and fire. For more information see

173 OSHA did implement changes to 29 CFR §1910.106, creating a new Hazard Communication Standard.
However, no changes have been made that impact the management of process safety under PSM. See
https://www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/ (accessed August 6, 2013).
174 Process safety indicators are also referred to as performance indicators, metrics, key process indicators (KPI),
performance measures, indicators, etc.

4.1 Duty Holder Safety Responsibility, including a Written Case for
Safety
Under the safety case regulatory regime, each individual company is responsible for the safety of each
hazardous facility. The onus is on the duty holder175 to prove to the regulator that the company’s
processes, methodologies used to assess risks, and reasoning for choosing one control over another have
substantially reduced risks to as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP), or equivalent. The duty holder
175 Duty holders are considered to be “those who create and/or have the greatest control of the risks associated with a
particular activity. Those who create the risks at the workplace are responsible for controlling them.” HSE.

may include operators, contractors, and subcontractors. According to NOPSEMA, the idea is that those who create

38

Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
is required to prepare a written case for safety176 (“safety case report”) that identifies the hazards and risks
and describes how they will be reduced to ALARP. The HSE has noted that the safety case report
“demonstrates that the duty holder has arrangements in place which, if implemented, are capable of
achieving compliance with legal objectives set out in other [] regulations…[and] provides a
comprehensive core document that can be used as a check by both the duty holder and HSE that the
accepted risk control measures and the health and safety management systems are in place and operate as
they should.”177 The HSE has also stated:
[t]he principal matters to be demonstrated in a safety case are that: a) the
management system is adequate to ensure compliance with statutory
health and safety requirements; and for management of arrangements
with contractors and sub-contractors, b) that adequate arrangements have
been made for audit and for audit reporting, [and] c) that all hazards with
the potential to cause a major accident have been identified, their risks
evaluated, and measures have been, or will be, taken to control those
risks to ensure that the relevant statutory provisions will be complied
with.178
The safety case report must also demonstrate “how inherently
safer design concepts have been applied in the design decisions
taken.”179 This principle applies to all stages of the
installation’s life cycle, and includes materials selection and
managing corrosion in the design.
It is also important to note that safety case reports are meant to
be evergreen documents that reflect continuous improvement in
risk reduction. For onshore operations in the UK, the duty
holder is required to review the safety case report during the
construction of a new facility, whenever new facts or technical
knowledge about safety matters become known, or whenever
the operator makes a change to the safety management system that could have significant impacts on the
prevention of major accidents.180 The duty holder must revise the safety report to ensure that it “remains
up to date and continues to provide an accurate representation of the major accident hazards…and the
176 The HSE defines “safety case” as “a document that gives confidence to both the duty holder and HSE that the
duty holder has the ability and means to control major accident risks effectively. It provides an extra level of
regulatory control on top of regulations such as the Offshore Installations (Prevention of Fire and Explosion, and
Emergency Response) Regulations 1995 (PFEER) and the Offshore Installations and Wells (Design and
Construction, etc) Regulations 1996 (DCR), justified by the major accident potential of the offshore activities within

measures in place to control them.”181 According to HSE guidance on the offshore Safety Case
Regulations, safety case reports are “intended to be living documents, kept up to date and revised as
necessary during the operational life of the installation.”182
In order for the facility to begin operation or remain in operation, the regulator must “accept” 183 the
facility’s safety case report; however, the regulator’s acceptance of a safety case does not license the
facility or installation as “fit,”184 nor does it shift the duty of risk control and reduction away from the
facility owner or operator and onto the regulator; rather, the duty of major accident prevention and risk
reduction to ALARP remains with the duty holder throughout the life of the facility. Following the
regulator’s acceptance of the safety case report, the duty holder must ensure that the installation is
operated in conformity with the management system and other provisions described in the safety case.185
In the US, facilities commence operation before they are inspected or evaluated for complying with PSM
or RMP regulations. In fact, the CSB has investigated incidents where the employer disputed that its
process was covered by the PSM standard or RMP regulations. Regulators do not evaluate and approve
PHAs or other hazard reviews and do not have the authority to license specific facilities for operation,
based on the adequacy of their process safety programs. If an operating facility contains processes
covered by the PSM standard, the facility must complete primarily activity-based regulatory requirements
at least once every five years. The employer has no general duty to continually reduce risk. RMP-
covered facilities must submit fairly high-level information exhibiting compliance with RMP
requirements at least once every five years. While the regulator ensures the RMP has been filed and
contains the required sections, there is no analysis of the effectiveness of controls identified in the RMP to
mitigate hazards.
4.2 Continuous Risk Reduction to ALARP
As discussed above, a majority of the safety case regimes implemented globally impose a duty on owners
or operators of covered facilities on and offshore to reduce risks to ALARP or equivalent. The Center for
Chemical Process Safety (CCPS) defines ALARP as “a risk reduction goal, where risk reduction efforts
are continued until the incremental effort to further reduce risk becomes grossly disproportionate to the
level of additional risk reduction.”186 This principle provides the regulator with the main foundation on

183 “Acceptance requires satisfaction with the duty holder’s approach to identifying and meeting health and safety
needs…HSE ‘accepts’ the validity of the described approach as being capable, if implemented as described, of
achieving the necessary degree of risk control, but HSE does not confirm the outcomes of that approach.”
Therefore, “HSE will accept a safety case or a revision…when duty holders demonstrate and describe specified
matters to HSE’s satisfaction. Acceptance will be based on HSE’s judgment that the arrangements and measures
described in the safety case taken as a whole are likely to achieve compliance if implemented as described. To give
acceptance HSE does not need to be satisfied that compliance will be achieved.…” Ibid at 6.

which to accept or reject a safety case report. In essence, the regulator ultimately determines whether
ALARP has been achieved through the authority to accept or reject the safety case report. An advantage
of ALARP as opposed to a prescriptive or activity-based approach is that ALARP results in the
continuous reduction of risk to keep up-to-date with advancing technology and industry best practices.187
Although two of the 14 PSM elements (PHA and mechanical integrity) contain performance-based or
goal-setting requirements, 188 the PSM standard does not provide a specific risk reduction target such as
ALARP.
In reviewing the safety case report, the regulator may accept
the application of relevant good practice as a sufficient
demonstration of ALARP.189 As the HSE notes, “the
measures in place to prevent or limit major accidents should
be described in the safety report and be at least to ‘relevant
good practice.’”190 According to Dr. Hopkins, the duty of
ALARP “provides leverage for the regulator…[i]f an
operator wishes to adopt a procedure or a standard that falls
short of good or best practice, the regulator can reject it on
the grounds that it does not reduce the risk as low as
reasonably practicable.”191 As noted above, regulators such
as HSE provide guidance on what is considered good
practice, and publish documents containing good practice
standards to assist operators with applying this concept.
However, the duty holder must make the case for the standard or practice being utilized, and the regulator
may determine that applying good practice alone is not sufficient to demonstrate that risks have been
reduced to ALARP. In addition, if there is no directly applicable rule or standard, operators still have a
duty to manage risk, and they therefore must maintain a reasonable level of risk awareness that goes
beyond mere compliance.192 This raises a safety case regime above the compliance mentality of a more
activity-based regime, such as PSM, and requires the duty-holder and the regulator to continuously ask
whether there are other measures that would be effective in further reducing risks.
The UK HSE provides ample guidance on determining what is considered to be ALARP, and many
British courts have interpreted the concept as well. In the 1949 case Edwards v. National Coal Board,
decided by the Court of Appeal, Judge Asquith wrote:
‘Reasonably practicable’ is a narrower term than ‘physically possible’
and seems to me to imply that a computation must be made by the

188 29 CFR §1910.119(e)(1) requires the employer to “identify, evaluate, and control the hazards involved in the

outside acceptable limits (defined by the process safety information in paragraph (d) of this section) before further
use or in a safe and timely manner when necessary means are taken to assure safe operation.”

owner, in which the quantum of risk is placed on one scale and the
sacrifice involved in the measures necessary for averting the risk
(whether in money, time or trouble) is placed in the other; and that if it
be shown that there is a gross disproportion between them – the risk
being insignificant in relation to the sacrifice – the defendants discharge
the onus on them.193
While some critics in the US have argued that the determination of ALARP is strictly a quantitative risk
assessment (QRA) calculation that is not sufficiently protective, the CSB has found that the HSE allows
reliance upon qualitative assessments, QRA, and semi-quantitative risk assessments to determine
ALARP.194 According to the HSE, essential considerations for determining whether a duty holder has
reduced risks to ALARP include “the adoption of inherently safer designs…”195 and “[i]dentification of
possible further measures that could be applied to lower the risk.”196 The HSE also notes that the
guidance to COMAH Regulation 4 (General Duty) “describes the application of all measures necessary to
reduce risk of a major accident to ALARP based on a hierarchical approach (inherent safety, prevention,
control, mitigation).”197 In Norway, the PSA requires companies to “select technical, operational and
organisational solutions that reduce the probability that harm, errors and hazard and accident situations
occur.”198 PSA regulations require companies to choose the solutions that offer the best results, provided
the costs are not significantly disproportionate to the risk reduction achieved.199 In Australia, the
NOPSEMA enforces the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 and its regulations,
which imposes a duty of care on the operator of a facility to “take all reasonably practicable steps” to
ensure the facility is safe and all work and other activities are “carried out in a manner that is safe and
193 Edwards, [1949] 1 K.B. at 704.
194 Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS) guidance on risk assessment implies that as the predicted
consequence of potential hazard scenarios increases, the level of analytical detail should also increase. Risk
assessment approaches range in order of increasing analytical detail from qualitative, to semi-quantitative, to
quantitative. Qualitative risk assessment is the simplest approach where judgments about consequence, likelihood,
and the tolerability of risk are made on a subjective basis using the knowledge and experience of team members and
may not be consistently applied within an organization. Semi-quantitative risk assessment is the second level of
analytical detail, where organizations develop and provide to team members predetermined risk matrices and
guidance for establishing numerical consequence and frequency levels. This approach is of greater value to team
members as based upon their collective experience; the team typically has a sense of how frequently an event might
occur and how great the potential consequence may be within the predetermined ranges. Layer of protection
analysis (LOPA) is a semi-quantitative form of risk assessment, using order of magnitude categories for evaluating
frequency, consequence, and adequacy of safeguards. Quantitative risk assessment involves the highest level of
analytical detail and typically involves specialized expertise to perform. Complex models are commonly developed
to evaluate frequency, consequence, and the effectiveness of safeguards in a quantitative risk assessment. Such
approaches are typically standardized to minimize result variability within an organization and even between
organizations in countries where a quantitative risk assessment is mandated by regulatory authorities. Center for

without risk to the health of any person at or near the facility.”200 NOPSEMA explains that to achieve
ALARP, the company “has to show, through reasoned and supported arguments, that there are no other
practical measures that could reasonably be taken to reduce risks further.”201
In the US, the NRC has “gradually revised its original scheme, giving an increasing importance to the
‘economic and social factors’, in particular the involvement of all ‘stakeholders’ (authorities,
management, staff, public) in the ALARA process.”202 For the regulator, the focus for whether ALARA
has been achieved is on “processes, procedures, and judgments.”203 The duty holder must ensure that
choices made to achieve ALARA are “fully documented together with the criteria which have brought to
those choices. When the criteria are qualitative, it is more likely that subjective judgments play a large
role, but those judgments must be equally recorded.”204
There is no corresponding duty to reduce risks to ALARP in the PSM standard or RMP program. Rather,
these regulations require that facilities “control” identified hazards, with no further dialogue on how far
the operator must go to control those hazards. Neither the facility nor the regulator is required to
determine whether more could be done to control hazards or reduce risks to comply with these
regulations, and this may result in the implementation of insufficient controls relating to a hazard.
While OSHA and the EPA do rely on general duty standards when implementing the PSM standard and
the RMP program, these duties do not drive onshore companies toward reducing the risks of their
activities to ALARP, and instead are utilized as enforcement tools typically after an incident has occurred,
meant to cover those activities not specifically regulated. These standards may also be used by OSHA or
EPA to cite a company for not following a specific RAGAGEP for 2 of the 14 process safety elements -
mechanical integrity and PSI.
OSHA enforces section 5(a) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHAct), which states the
following:
(a) Each employer –
(1) shall furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of
employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or
are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees;
(2) shall comply with occupational safety and health standards
promulgated under this act…205
Section 5(a)(1), also known as OSHA’s General Duty Clause, has been described as a “catch-all”
provision meant to fill gaps in OSHA law for recognized unregulated hazards.206,207 In order for OSHA to

issue a General Duty Clause violation, the hazard must be recognized, the employer must have failed to
keep the workplace free of the hazard to which his or her employees were exposed, a practical method
must be available to correct the hazard, and the hazard must be causing or likely to cause death or serious
injury.208 This duty would thus only apply if the absence or failure of one control in a series of controls
makes an accident likely to occur (emphasis added).
On the other hand, in a safety case regulatory regime, the regulator proactively reviews identified hazards
and risk reduction strategies proposed by the operator to ensure that risks are being reduced to ALARP.
The regulator may require the installation of an absent control if such a control is considered good
industry practice, or if it goes further in reducing risks to ALARP. This is a key feature of the safety case
approach in preventing major accidents.
Under the CAA, the General Duty Clause requires owners and operators “to identify hazards which may
result from such releases using appropriate hazard assessment techniques, to design and maintain a safe
facility taking such steps as are necessary to prevent releases, and to minimize the consequences of
accidental releases which do occur.”209 Similar to OSHA, the EPA can use its General Duty Clause
enforcement authority to create legally binding requirements or enforce actions for hazards that have not
been specifically regulated. The EPA can use this authority proactively (before an incident) or reactively
(following an incident), and can enforce the clause where it finds the possibility of imminent and
substantial endangerment.210
According to EPA guidance on the RMP program, because it is the owner or operator’s duty to “prevent
accidents and ensure safety at [their] source…” this may require steps to be taken “beyond those specified
in the risk management program rule.”211 While this principle appears to be similar to ALARP
requirements of the safety case, in practice whether this is done is not subject to regulation or review. In
addition, it is permissive in that it uses the word “may.” Nothing additional, such as ALARP, is required.
This will be addressed below in more detail in the discussion of implementation of the EPA RMP
program in California.
4.3 Adaptability and Continuous Improvement
A key strength of the safety case regulatory regime is that it provides the regulator with the tools to drive
continuous improvement among facilities and ensure risks have been reduced to ALARP or equivalent,
rather than focusing on compliance with activity-based regulatory requirements. Although complying
with good practice may achieve ALARP, the regulator also has the ability under this regime to require
facilities to go above and beyond good practices and standards to achieve ALARP without requiring

rulemaking. The Baker Panel212 noted in its 2007 report (“the Baker Report”) on BP and its process
safety performance following the 2005 BP Texas City disaster that an effective process safety
management system builds upon an “improvement cycle” that “should include, in practice, continuous
reduction of process risk and improvements in safety performance according to some measurable
criteria.”213
The Baker Panel defined “continuous improvement” as
• improving controls for process hazards, including process safety knowledge
and competence of workers;
• improving process safety leadership of supervisors;
• improving process engineering to identify and then design to remove or
mitigate the effects of process hazards;
• going beyond legal compliance to best practices to reduce risks;
• going beyond mere compliance with internal standards, but learning from
operating experiences, incident and near miss investigations, hazard studies,
audits, and other assessments to improve those internal standards; and
• identifying and implementing not only those external standards that must be
observed, but also those that represent best practices that can lead to process
safety excellence.214
An independent review conducted of the Australian offshore safety case regime in 2000 echoes the
importance of continuous improvement in process safety management, stating that “critical to the
successful implementation of a safety case regime is the achievement of a qualitative shift in industry and
regulatory safety cultures from the minimalist compliance of the prescriptive regime to the philosophy of
best practice and continuous improvement.”215 Recently, Lord Cullen addressed the importance of
adaptability as well, when he spoke at the 2013 Oil & Gas UK Piper 25 offshore safety conference in
Aberdeen, Scotland.216 In his keynote speech, Lord Cullen quoted the Maitland panel, which examined
the UK offshore safety regime after the Macondo incident, noting that “safety cases should be living
documents [emphasis added] central to the way facilities are operated, with contents widely
understood.”217
212 In the aftermath of the BP Texas City Incident, BP followed the recommendation of the CSB and formed an
independent panel known as the Baker Panel to conduct a thorough review of the company’s corporate safety
culture, safety management systems, and corporate safety oversight at its US refineries. For a copy of their findings

Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
As changes to regulatory requirements necessitate an extensive, lengthy rulemaking process in the US,218
process safety-related regulations can remain static for decades, while industry standards (many of which
are voluntary under the current US system), technologies, and improved procedures and practices
continue to change and advance, and new chemicals come into production. In light of major accidents
that have occurred, such as the BP Texas City explosion and fire which resulted in 15 fatalities, and the
Motiva Enterprises sulfuric acid tank explosion, which fatally injured one worker and injured eight others,
the CSB has made a number of key recommendations to OSHA and the EPA to revise the PSM and RMP
regulations, respectively. However, agencies have failed to implement these recommendations and these
regulations have remained static despite the important lessons learned from these incidents. In addition,
the OSHA PSM standard’s Appendix A, which contains a list of toxic and reactive highly hazardous
chemicals and the threshold quantity for each, was originally created using a number of older sources,
including the EPA’s “Extremely Hazardous Substance List,” the 1982 Seveso Directive, the 1984
CIMAH regulations, and others. A number of these sources have been revised, updated, and amended
throughout the years, while Appendix A has not. In fact, no chemicals have been added to either the PSM
or the RMP programs since the rules were initially adopted in the 1990s, even as numerous serious
process incidents have occurred involving chemicals that were not listed.
The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) published a 2012 report on OSHA’s standard setting
abilities, and noted that between 1981 and 2010, OSHA took anywhere from 15 months to 19 years to
develop and issue 58 significant safety and health standards (averaging seven years).219 According to the
report, OSHA reasoned that it must evaluate technological and economic feasibility of a potential
standard using data gathered by visiting worksites in industries that will be affected, on an industry-by-
industry basis.220 This was described as “an enormous undertaking because, for example, it requires visits
to multiple worksites.”221 In addition, Executive Order 12866222 requires that federal agencies, including
OSHA, provide an assessment of the potential overall costs and benefits for significant rules to the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB). OSHA will typically be required under the Small Business
Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996223 to initiate a panel process to receive and consider input
218 5 U.S.C. Chapter 5, sections 511-599, also known as the Administrative Procedure Act, or APA, requires that
federal agencies seeking to promulgate a rule or regulation submit to a lengthy notice and comment rulemaking
process that includes publishing the proposed rule making in the Federal Register; providing the public with at least
30 days to participate in the rulemaking process by submitting written comments or data, and then discussing the
public comments and providing a rationale for accepting or rejecting them. The OSHAct Section 6(b) specifies the
procedures OSHA must use to promulgate, modify, or revoke its standards (29 U.S.C. §655(b)). These procedures
include publishing the proposed rule in the Federal Register, providing interested persons an opportunity comment,
and holding a public hearing upon request.

from representatives of affected small businesses, which could take eight months or more.224 Only
OSHA, the EPA, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are subject to this requirement.225
Finally, the OSHAct directs courts to review OSHA’s standards using a more stringent legal standard
than the Administrative Procedure Act’s (APA’s) “arbitrary and capricious” test226 when reviewing
OSHA’s standards;227 an OSHA standard may only be upheld if it is supported by “substantial evidence
in the record considered as a whole.”228 According to the GAO report, OSHA officials claim this more
stringent standard (known as the “substantial evidence” standard) requires a higher level of scrutiny by
the courts and as a result, OSHA staff must conduct a large volume of detailed research in order to
understand all industrial processes involved in the hazard being regulated, and to ensure that a given
hazard control would be feasible for each process.229 The GAO also found that although OSHA has the
ability to address urgent hazards by issuing emergency temporary standards, the agency has not used this
authority since 1983 because of the difficult hurdles the agency faces in presenting the evidence necessary
to meet the statutory requirements.230 In summary, all of these extensive rulemaking constraints have
resulted in OSHA’s inability to undertake many standard revisions or improvements.
In Spring 2013, OSHA announced its new regulatory agenda, which stated that one of the things OSHA
plans to consider is revising the PSM standard to “address gaps in safety coverage.”231 Potential revisions
include “expanding coverage and requirements for reactivity hazards,” which the CSB addressed in its
2002 report entitled “Improving Reactive Hazard Management,”232 and “expanding the scope of

226 Pursuant to the APA, agency decisions may be set aside only if “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or
otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. §706(2)(A). There is abundant case law that discusses this
standard. Courts have held that a court “may reverse under the arbitrary and capricious standard only if the agency
has relied on factors that Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of
the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so
implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise. See Greater

paragraph (j) to cover the mechanical integrity of any safety-critical equipment….”233 However, OSHA
has proposed changes to the PSM standard before, with no action ultimately being taken. On April 27,
1998, OSHA announced that it was considering issuing an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking234
(ANPRM) “to address issues related to reactive chemicals raised by the explosion of a chemical plant in
Lodi, New Jersey in 1995.”235,236 On May 14, 2001, OSHA clarified its intent to publish an ANPRM “to
address the need to add reactive chemicals that are not currently covered by PSM…”237 On December 3,
2001, however, the entry on reactives was withdrawn from the rulemaking agenda.238 Following the
devastating ammonium nitrate explosion on April 17, 2013, in West, Texas, which resulted in at least 14
fatalities and mass destruction in the town of West, CSB Chairperson Moure-Eraso urged both OSHA and
the EPA to expand their standards to include reactive chemicals and hazards such as ammonium nitrate.239
On July 25, 2013, the CSB held a public meeting in Washington, DC to discuss the status of key open
recommendations the CSB has made to OSHA over the last decade to revise its PSM standard and create
a new combustible dust standard. These recommendations, which include revising the PSM standard to
require MOC reviews for organizational changes such as mergers and acquisitions that may impact
process safety, and ensuring PSM coverage for atmospheric storage tanks that could be involved in a
potential catastrophic release, have stemmed from major CSB investigations including its BP Texas City,
Motiva, ConAgra, Kleen, Imperial Sugar, and Hoeganaes investigations, as well as its Combustible Dust
Study.240 OSHA’s failure to implement these recommendations, which can be attributed to its lack of
rulemaking activities over the last decade, led the CSB to reclassify seven key open recommendations as
“Open-Unacceptable.” The CSB also adopted the OSHA Combustible Dust Standard recommendation as
a CSB “Most Wanted Chemical Safety Improvement.” OSHA formally responded and cited to the GAO
report discussed above, noting that on average, it takes OSHA seven years to issue a standard, a process

234 Most federal agencies develop rules through “informal rulemaking.” Under the Administrative Procedure Act, or
APA, informal rulemaking requires a publication of a “Notice of Proposed Rulemaking” (NPRM) in the Federal
Register; opportunity for public participation by submission of written comments; consideration by the agency of the
public comments and other relevant material; and publication of a final rule not less than 30 days before its effective
date, with a statement explaining the purpose of the rule. Under the APA, an agency may publish an Advance
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) when the agency wants to test out a proposal or solicit ideas before it
drafts its NPRM. For more information see http://www.foreffectivegov.org/node/226 (accessed September 17,

that is only getting longer. Hence, OSHA reserves rulemaking for “widespread and serious hazards.”
Needed petroleum refinery and chemical process safety improvements may never fall under this category.
OSHA noted at the meeting that it would be utilizing a Request for Information241 (RFI) to aid in the
revision of its PSM standard, aimed at addressing a number of issues that have developed in the 21 years
since the PSM standard was promulgated in 1992. On December 9, 2013, OSHA published its RFI in the
Federal Register.242 The RFI requests comment on potential revisions to OSHA’s PSM standard, among
other regulations. The RFI identifies seventeen topics for potential rulemaking and enforcement changes,
including clarifying the PSM exemption for atmospheric storage tanks and expanding PSM coverage and
requirements for reactive hazards. The RFI also cites a number of CSB investigation reports and
recommendations, including the CSB Reactive Hazard Study entitled Improving Reactive Hazard
Management, the BP Texas City Investigation Report, and the Donaldson Enterprises, Inc., Investigation
Report.243 Although the RFI is an important opportunity to enhance the dialogue on implementation of
the safety case regulatory approach to enhance process safety management and risk reduction in the US, it
does not specifically mention the safety case approach.244
On January 3, 2014, OSHA released a response to Section 6(a) of Executive Order 13650,245 which
tasked the Chemical Facility Safety and Security Working Group, created by the Order and consisting of
federal agencies such as OSHA, the EPA, and PHMSA,246 with considering options to improve chemical
safety regulation. The document provides separate responses from each member agency of the group, and
notes that the group is seeking public input on potential areas where standards could be improved.
According to the document, three agencies – OSHA, the EPA, and PHMSA – have all included

model to reduce risk in complex industrial processes” in a preliminary list of options to consider for
improving chemical facility and safety.247
OSHA’s ability to adapt to process safety-related new or revised codes, standards, technology, and
lessons learned is mainly limited to RAGAGEP requirements, which OSHA included in the mechanical
integrity and PSI elements of its PSM standard in part to “provide flexibility for the employer to choose
the frequency which would provide the best assurance of equipment integrity.”248 OSHA meant for
RAGAGEP to include “both appropriate internal standards and applicable codes and standards.…”249
However, the concept of RAGAGEP only applies to 2 of the 14 PSM standard elements (mechanical
integrity and PSI),250 only addresses equipment and mechanical integrity, and is usually utilized by
OSHA as a mechanism to issue citations to companies post-incident.
In addition, OSHA has had difficulty enforcing RAGAGEP citations. In a recent OSHA Review
Commission proceeding, Secretary of Labor v BP Products North America, Inc., & BP-Husky Refining,
LLC,251 and United Steelworkers Local 1-346, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) vacated OSHA
RAGAGEP citations issued to BP for violations of 29 CFR §1910.119(d)(3)(ii)252 for failure to comply
with a specific RAGAGEP, holding that OSHA impermissibly adopted a specific RAGAGEP, thereby
diminishing the performance aspect of the RAGAGEP requirements contained within the OSHA PSM
standard. The ALJ concluded that by citing to only one specific RAGAGEP, OSHA impermissibly
adopted a prescriptive standard; in the ALJ’s view, OSHA should have acknowledged other possible
RAGAGEPs for BP to comply with, including BP’s own internal standards. If upheld, this ruling may
limit OSHA’s ability to utilize RAGAGEP as a means of requiring companies to implement industry
good practices in the future.253
The cumbersome rulemaking process and lack of flexibility that has resulted in stagnant and static OSHA
standards can be contrasted with the structure of the safety case regulatory regime, which facilitates
adaptability and enables the regulator to improve industry safety performance and practices without
requiring a major rule change. The safety case essentially provides the regulator with the tools to
recognize more rigorous standards and practices that exist and drive a company to implement those
practices to further reduce risks, as well as work with industry to improve existing standards and practices
if necessary. It also enables companies to implement new, more efficient or safer technologies that do not
necessarily meet strict prescriptive regulations, but that drive risk reduction.
This adaptability is illustrated by the HSE’s recommendations following the 2004 Buncefield incident.
On December 11, 2005, a number of explosions occurred at Buncefield Oil Storage Depot in Hemel
Hemptstead, Hertfordshire, England following the overfilling of a gasoline tank. Over 40 people were
injured and there was significant offsite damage to homes and businesses. An independently chaired
Major Incident Investigation Board led by Lord Newton of Braintree was set up to investigate the
incident. Between 2006 and 2008 the Board issued a number of reports and recommendations. In the

report issued in March 2007 entitled “Recommendations on the design and operation of fuel storage
sites,” the Board highlighted the adaptability of the existing regulatory regime by noting that the
recommendations to improve standards and revise guidance should not require actual changes to the law,
because the existing legal framework was “sufficient to ensure that necessary improvements are put in
place.”254 The Board followed by making its first recommendation of the report to the COMAH CA and
operators of Buncefield-type sites to develop and agree on a methodology to determine safety integrity
level requirements for overfill prevention systems, which takes account of, among other things, nearby
resources or populations.255 The Board also recommended that the sector “develop guidance to
incorporate the latest knowledge on preventing loss of primary containment and on inhibiting escalation if
loss occurs.”256 Another key recommendation was made to the CA to “ensure that safety reports
submitted under the COMAH Regulations contain information to demonstrate that good practice in
human and organisational design, operation, maintenance and testing is implemented as rigorously as for
control and environmental protection engineering systems.”257 Finally, the Board recommended in this
report that the “sector agree with the Competent Authority on a system of leading258 and lagging259
performance indicators for process safety performance…” based on HSE’s guidance on Developing
process safety indicators.260
Spurred by recommendations made surrounding the Buncefield incident, the BP Texas City incident, and
the BP Grangemouth incident,261 the COMAH CA developed an Operational Delivery Guide entitled
“COMAH Competent Authority Workstream 2e: Process safety performance indicators,”262 which was
“designed to continue the promotion and development of site level process safety performance indicators
(PSPIs) as part of the monitoring arrangements for an effective process safety management system at
major hazard sites.”263 The guide states that by the end of March 2013 all “Buncefield-type” sites would
“have effective monitoring of process safety performance in place and that site specific leading and
lagging performance indicators have been developed…”264 and that by the end of 2015 “all major hazard
establishments and duty holders will measure their performance on the control of major hazard risks by
way of key leading and lagging performance indicators.”265 It lays out in detail a six-step process for
implementing a process safety measurement system; how inspectors will assess a duty holder’s

performance; and adds that full implementation of this program could take between 18 months and two
and a half years from when the initial introduction takes place – all without requiring any fundamental
changes to the COMAH regulations themselves.
The COMAH CA Investigation Team noted in its publication summarizing the conclusions of the
Buncefield investigation that following the incident, the CA, industry, and trade unions worked together
to “drive forward high standards at fuel storage sites…[which] has resulted in agreement on improved
standards of safety and environmental protection for all UK sites storing large volumes of gasoline and to
systematically upgrade sites to meet these standards….”266
In another example following the Buncefield incident, the Board recommended significantly higher
standards than were generally in place in the sector. For example, the Board recommended that fuel
storage tanks be fitted with automatic overfill protection equipment that would cut off supply if an overfill
event occurs, rather than continuing to rely on operators to interrupt flow manually in the case of an
event. In response, the UK Petroleum Industry Association and the Tank Storage Association adopted the
recommendation, and the British government announced that it would require all sites to move to fully
automatic shutdown systems on tanks storing gasoline. The Process Safety Leadership Group (PSLG)
was formed to help develop the details of the new rule, and to “meet the need for an effective framework
for interaction between industry, trade unions and the COMAH Competent Authority (CA).…”267 As
will be discussed in the next section, workforce involvement is a key element of an effective safety case
regulatory regime. In 2009, HSE published the PSLG’s work in a document entitled Safety and
Environmental Standards for Fuel Storage Sites. The document lays out precisely which tanks must
utilize automatic overfill protection equipment, and also allows for duty holders to demonstrate technical
reasons as to why automatic overfill protection would not be appropriate by “prepar[ing] a robust
demonstration that alternative measures are capable of achieving an equivalent ALARP outcome to an
overfill protection system that is automatic…”268 This document in essence was developed as an industry
good practice, and compliance with its requirements would likely ensure that the duty holder is complying
with the law and reducing risks to ALARP.269
This can be contrasted with an even larger release of gasoline and a subsequent explosion that occurred in
the 2009 tank overfill at the Caribbean Petroleum Corporation near San Juan, Puerto Rico. This incident
severely damaged surrounding buildings and impacted moving vehicles. However, the incident has not
resulted in any re-evaluation of safety rules by the EPA or OSHA, despite the fact that tank terminals
largely fall outside the PSM and RMP program regulations, (let alone the more rigorous requirements of a
major hazard safety case regulatory regime, as practiced in the UK).
These post-Buncefield examples highlight one of the most important attributes of the safety case
regulatory approach: it is a regulatory framework that implements a balance of goal-setting and
prescriptive elements which enable the regulator to drive facilities to continuously improve practices

aimed at reducing risks to ALARP, without having to adhere to the extensive and time-consuming
rulemaking requirements that exist in the US. This flexibility and adaptability encourages facilities to
focus on improving practices and technology rather than on completing activity-based requirements,
which can have the effect of stifling innovation and technological advancement.
Critics argue that because there have been significant industry problems with the maintenance of safety
critical equipment and aging equipment in the UK, 270 the safety case regime is not operating effectively.
Regulators and commissions in the UK have found degradation of pipes, valves, and other equipment at
many facilities due to company deferral of maintenance, insufficient testing of safety-critical elements,
and a continuing industry culture of responding to disasters. However, the HSE has worked to make
improvements to these areas. In 2010, the UK HSE initiated Key Programme 4 to address the issue of
aging equipment offshore and the operation of installations beyond their design life.271 The same year,
the HSE published a report intended to inform industry and aid in the prevention of major accidents
entitled Managing Ageing Plant: A Summary Guide,272 which provides an overview of ageing plant
mechanisms and their management. This document presents analysis and findings for loss of containment
incidents to demonstrate how aging plant equipment may be a factor. The HSE has been able to take this
type of programmatic proactive approach in the UK thanks to the safety case regime’s adaptive nature,
which is lacking in the US both on and offshore. This is positive evidence of a competent and effective
regulator with the tools under the safety case regime to identify and proactively address industry gaps in
safety performance.
4.4 Active Workforce Participation
As the CSB noted in its Interim Report on the Chevron incident, workforce participation is a key element
of process safety and effective major accident prevention. In one of its publications, the Center for
Chemical Process Safety (CCPS) lists workforce involvement as one of 20 essential management
components necessary to reduce process safety risks and prevent chemical accidents.273 According to
CCPS,
…workers are potentially the most knowledgeable people with respect to
the day-to-day details of operating the process and maintaining the
equipment and facilities and may be the sole source for some types of
knowledge gained through their unique experiences. Workforce
involvement provides management a mechanism for tapping into this
valuable expertise.274
This CCPS publication discusses general areas of workforce involvement in risk assessments, inspections,
audits, and performance reviews, and notes that participation leads to empowerment, management
270 The HSE published a report to communicate the results and conclusions of the Asset Integrity Key Programme
carried out between 2004 and 2007 by the Health and Safety Executive’s Offshore Division. See

responsiveness, and process safety performance improvement. 275 The OSHA PSM standard requires
employers to consult with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of PHAs
and on the development of the 13 remaining PSM elements, and to develop a written plan of action
regarding the implementation of the employee participation required under this section.276 During facility
inspections, OSHA inspectors must request and evaluate these written plans of action regarding the
implementation of employee participation as well as interview employees and their representatives to
verify that the employer is satisfying the requirements.277
In previous investigation reports, the CSB has identified that workers and their representatives play a very
important role in major incident prevention. For example, as will be discussed in the next section on
performance indicators, the CSB recommended in its BP Texas City Final Investigation Report that BP
and the United Steelworkers Union (USW) establish a joint program to report incidents and near misses,
and to ensure that recommendations made during investigations were implemented. The CSB also
recommended that API and the USW work together to develop a safety standard addressing leading and
lagging process safety indicators.278 However, representatives from the USW have stated to the CSB that
it is a constant struggle for workers and their representatives to have a voice or play a role in the
management of safety in US petroleum refineries.
The law in the UK also requires employers to consult with their employees or their safety representatives
on health and safety matters. The Safety Representatives and Safety Committees Regulations 1977 and
the Health and Safety (Consultation with Employees) Regulations 1996 set out the legal framework for
such consultation and worker involvement at both unionized and non-unionized onshore facilities.279
However, these regulations go further than the OSHA PSM standard in that they provide for the election
of safety representatives by the workers to serve many health and safety-related functions, including
investigating complaints and accidents and carrying out inspections. In his keynote speech at the Oil and
Gas UK Piper 25 conference, Lord Cullen stated that the safety representative positions have “important
functions, such as the power to carry out investigations and reporting safety concerns to management,
without fear of recrimination,” noting that they “help[] reinforce the principle that each employee is
responsible for his own safety.”280 The regulations also require employers to establish a safety committee
when one is requested by at least two health and safety representatives. The 1996 regulations require
employers to consult with employees not represented by safety representatives under the 1977

Regulations on a number of health and safety-related matters, such as the introduction of any measure
which may substantially affect their health and safety at work, the planning and organization of health and
safety training, and the health and safety consequences of introducing new technology.281 The law in the
UK protects employees from being penalized for taking part in health and safety consultation.282
The UK’s existing regulations and policies regarding worker involvement offshore were developed and
strengthened as a result of the Piper Alpha incident. In the Piper Alpha Report, Lord Cullen emphasized
the importance of workforce involvement in safe operations, and noted that a safety committee system is
“the most visible instrument for the involvement of the workforce in safety.”283 He concluded by
recommending that “the regulatory body, operators and contractors should support and encourage the
involvement of the offshore workforce in safety.”284 The HSE developed guidance in response to Lord
Cullen’s recommendations entitled Play your part! How offshore workers can help improve health and
safety, intended to encourage workforce participation offshore.285 The most current version of this
guidance document, which was prepared by the Workforce Involvement Group,286 located within the
HSE’s Offshore Industry Advisory Committee,287 utilizes good practice and examples of successful
workforce involvement in improving health and safety with the goal of assisting operators, contractors,
safety representatives, and others in effectively utilizing workforce involvement in their workplaces. It
encourages companies to facilitate workforce involvement by providing information, improving
communication at all levels, good training, and ensuring that all workers are represented in the decisions
that affect them.288
The Piper Alpha incident also resulted in the swift development of the SI971 Offshore Regulations
(Safety Representatives and Safety Committees) Regulations 1989 (“the SI971 Regulations”), which
provide for the nomination and election of safety representatives and require offshore installations to
establish safety committees.289290 The HSE has published a guidance document entitled A guide to the

289 Under Regulation 16, safety representatives are responsible for investigating potential hazards and incidents,
examining causes of accidents, investigating complaints by any member of his or her constituency relating to
occupational health and safety, representing members of the workforce in consultations on the offshore installation
with inspectors, and consulting constituency members on any matters arising out of the Regulation. Under
Regulation 17, a safety representative may inspect any part of the offshore installation or its equipment either on a

Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
Offshore Installations (Safety Representatives and Safety Committees) Regulations 1989291 designed to
assist duty holders, employers, installation managers, safety representatives, safety committee members
and all members of the workforce in the offshore industry with what the regulations require and what
must be done to comply with them. The document explains that although the primary responsibility for
health and safety resides with the duty holder, “all members of the workforce must play their part if risks
are to be eliminated or minimized.”292 It also emphasizes the importance of training of safety
representatives, which enables them to effectively represent workers and fulfill their responsibilities and
functions under these Regulations.
In April 2010, the HSE launched an inspection project to examine the effectiveness of the SI971
Regulations and the effectiveness of those regulations, as well as to collect examples of best practice to
present to the offshore industry.293 Forty-one inspections were completed in a six-month period on
offshore installations operated by 25 different duty holders. The project helped focus on the power of
safety representatives and how to strengthen their ability to effectively perform their duties. It also was
well-received by the safety representatives, as it gave them encouragement and recognition, and sent a
message to management on the importance of SI971 and the key role of
safety representatives and committees in workplace health and safety.
The HSE has placed great emphasis and importance on the role of
worker involvement and consultation in improving workplace health
and safety and reducing major accidents on and offshore. In June 2009,
HSE launched a new strategy entitled Be part of the solution, which
lists workforce involvement as one of its main priorities, and the
agency has published a significant amount of guidance on worker
involvement and consultation on its website.294
The Norwegian Working Environment Act addresses the rights and
duties of safety representatives and committees in Norway. It applies
to nearly all workers in Norway, including onshore and offshore oil
workers. The Act provides for the election of government recognized safety representatives whose duty
is to “safeguard the interests or employees in matters of the working environment.”295 These

brings an independent look at health and safety factors from the workforce viewpoint. Workers are in the front line

representatives have the right to information, consultation, and participation in inspections.296 Unlike in
the UK currently, they also have the legal authority to halt unsafe work until the regulator decides when
the work may continue.297
A fundamental element in effective safety management for major accident prevention is active and equal
participation from the regulator, industry, and labor. Each entity provides unique and essential insights,
and removing the participation of these entities removes a critical voice in health and safety matters. In
the UK and Norway, tripartite systems consisting of industry, the regulator, and the workforce have been
established to deal with safety and health issues at the highest levels beyond just site workforce
representation.
The CSB investigation staff has had extensive discussions with worker representatives who have voiced
their opinions on their systems to the CSB. Roy Furre, a Representative from the Norwegian Union of
Energy Workers, spoke at the CSB’s 2010 public hearing on the Regulatory Approaches to Offshore Oil
and Gas Safety, and stated that the Norwegian working environment and the accompanying petroleum
regulations empower unions and safety delegates in all phases of the petroleum activities.298 He also
noted that the Norwegian petroleum regulations require that all necessary information about risks and
decisions be given to the workers’ representatives.299 During the CSB’s public hearing on Safety
Performance Indicators in July 2012, Jake Molloy, the Regional Organizer for the National Union of Rail,
Maritime and Transport Workers in the UK, stated that the input of workers is “crucial” in major accident
prevention and that “if the people operating these systems and delivering these results are unable for any
reason to tell you what the true picture is, everything else is worthless.”300 When speaking at a “Step
Change for Safety” Conference in Aberdeen, Scotland, on September 5, 2012, Mr. Molloy noted that
attending the public hearing in Houston was “eye opening” and that hearing about the US system was like
a “walk back in time.”301

4.5 Process Safety Indicators that Drive Performance
As the CSB noted in both its July 2012 public hearing on Safety
Performance Indicators and its Chevron Interim Report, leading and
lagging process safety indicators help drive continuous process safety
improvement, as long as regulators utilize these indicators to focus
inspections, audits, and investigations, and organizations focus attention
on them in a way that makes a difference. Process safety indicators are a
significant element of process safety management systems. They
measure the strengths and weaknesses of these systems to achieve and
maintain safe and reliable operations302 and, if properly defined, collected
and used, can identify the successes and flaws of the system.303
Lagging indicators are a “form of reactive monitoring”304 that includes
events such as major spills, fires, or gas releases. Leading indicators, on
the other hand, are a “form of active monitoring,”305 and are described as events that do not result in
severe consequences and usually address safety system performance, such as deviations from safe
operating limits or timely maintenance on safety critical equipment.306 Leading indicators “can be
considered as measures of process or inputs essential to deliver the desired safety outcome.”307 The
general thinking globally is that if companies rely primarily on lagging indicator data, which is
retrospective, they are not effectively managing process safety to ensure major accidents are prevented.
According to the HSE, “[t]oo many organizations rely heavily on failure data to monitor performance, so
improvements or changes are only determined after something has gone wrong. Discovering weaknesses
in control systems by having a major incident is too late and too costly.”308 Rather, facilities must
identify critical controls to monitor and set leading indicators against each one to show that the system is
operating as intended.
The HSE was one of the earliest regulators to adopt process safety indicators regulations. In 1995, the
agency began requiring companies to report health and safety data, and then published annual reports
based on those statistics. In 2006, the HSE developed a step-by-step guidance document entitled
Developing process safety indicators309 to assist industry. The guide establishes and discusses in detail
six main steps necessary to implement a process safety measurement system, including developing
leading and lagging indicators. It also defines leading and lagging indicators for each of the controls in
the risk control system. According to Jake Molloy, “[i]t is our firm belief that the most influential and

effective schemes using indicators to measure improvements and major accident prevention are those
initiatives generated by our regulator, the Health and Safety Executive [HSE].”310
As discussed in the previous section, a number of large incidents, including BP Texas City and BP
Grangemouth, have highlighted the need for the chemical and other major hazard sectors to demonstrate
that risks are being adequately controlled. In response to recommendations stemming from such
incidents, the COMAH CA developed an Operational Delivery Guide in 2010 on process safety
performance indicators setting out four stages to aid facilities in the development of process safety
indicators. The document sets out a goal that by the end of 2015 major hazard establishments and duty
holders will measure their safety performance and control of risk by way of key leading and lagging
performance indicators.
Following the 2005 BP Texas City incident, BP developed company-wide process safety indicators, and
now includes process safety metrics in performance contracts for its US refinery managers.311 However,
existing guidance in the US pertaining to safety performance indicators does not adequately aid
companies in managing major hazards onshore. The CSB has noted that in virtually every incident it
investigates in the US, process safety indicators are either not used at all or not used effectively.312
Millions of workplaces around the US primarily measure their safety performance using OSHA
recordable injury and illness rates, which include slips, trips, and falls. While collecting this type of data
is also necessary in hazardous operations, it is not sufficient. Injury rates do not depict the effectiveness
of a high hazard facility’s process safety management program.313 For example, the CSB noted in its BP
Texas City investigation that BP’s personal injury metrics were described as being at the best level on
record; yet, around this same time, in March 2005, BP Texas City experienced the devastating 15-fatality
incident, which resulted from a progressive erosion of process safety performance that was not reflected
in injury statistics.
Following the BP Texas City incident, a number of key recommendations were made to strengthen
guidance on indicators in the US. For example, the Baker Panel314 issued the Baker report, which
recommended the incorporation of safety indicators to measure safety performance, and stated:
The Panel believes that relying exclusively or predominantly on lagging
indicators to assess process safety performance is ill-advised. … BP’s
reliance on lagging, after-the-fact indicators of process safety
performance rather than leading, predictive measures…impaired BP’s
ability to measure, monitor and detect deteriorating or degraded process
safety conditions and performance… This failure to use a set of effective
performance metrics that includes leading indicators increased the

314 In the aftermath of the BP Texas City Incident, BP followed the recommendation of the CSB and formed an
independent panel known as the Baker Panel to conduct a thorough review of the company’s corporate safety
culture, safety management systems, and corporate safety oversight at its US refineries. For a copy of their findings
and recommendations see

likelihood that the organisation would identify the need for
improvements or additional controls only after something had gone
wrong.315
The Baker Panel also noted that it was not enough just to develop process indicators: these indicators
needed to be meaningful to the company. As such, the Baker Panel also recommended that “a significant
proportion of total compensation of refining line managers and supervisors [be] contingent on
satisfactorily meeting process safety performance goals….”316
In its final investigation report on the incident, the CSB made a recommendation to API and the USW to
jointly lead development of a consensus standard for leading and lagging process safety indicators to
drive performance improvements in the prevention of major incidents. API responded by issuing RP 754,
Process Safety Performance Indicators for the Refining and Petrochemical Industries. However, this
voluntary standard, which defines a framework of four tiered indicators that incorporate the concepts of
lagging to leading measures, has significant shortcomings, as the CSB described in a two-day public
hearing on Safety Performance Indicators that was held in July 2012. The CSB analysis found that the
ability of RP 754 to drive performance improvement and inform key stakeholders will be hampered by
• lagging indicators with insufficient statistical rigor needed to allow for trending or incremental
performance improvements;
• the lack of well-defined standardized and normalized leading indicators that are needed for
comparison among sites, corporations, or to national averages;
• weak employee protection requirements; public reporting requirements that will be ineffective to
adequately inform stakeholders; and
• the lack of broadly based consensus in the standard’s development process.317
As a result, in 2012 the CSB Board designated the response to the CSB’s recommendation as “open-
acceptable,”318 meaning that the recommendations recipient is moving in the right direction, but more
remains to be done.
The CSB also noted in the Chevron Interim Report the important role the public plays in monitoring
safety management systems, and referenced CCPS as promoting the sharing of process safety indicators
with the public:
Sharing performance metrics and results broadly can engage the public
as a partner in holding the organization accountable for process safety
performance. Making metrics and performance public can be an
especially powerful way of maintaining upper management commitment
since it will likely be the CEO or other senior managers who will be
called to account by the public if goals are not met or performance
declines. Communicating process safety successes also demonstrates to

employees and the public that positive change can be, and are being,
made within an organization.319
The Petroleum Safety Authority (PSA) in Norway provides annual reports to the public on its website
assessing indicators it has collected directly from offshore and onshore major hazard facilities since 2000
and 2006, respectively. The PSA utilizes the indicators data found in these reports to identify critical
safety areas that must be targeted for improvement in order to prevent near misses and accidents.320 The
onshore report, Risk level in the petroleum industry, Onshore facilities,321, 322 includes a description and
explanation of the indicators collected and analysis of these data. In this report the PSA notes a
decreasing trend in the number of reported hydrocarbon leaks on offshore production facilities between
2007 and 2010.323 However, it is too soon for PSA to assess trends in the onshore indicators data,
because the time period for onshore data collection has been relatively short and there are fewer data
points with only eight facilities onshore. The PSA also indicated that it will take time for the onshore
data to improve as indicators are refined, but recognized that the same approach has already yielded
good results in the offshore sector.324 Additional information on data and trends based on safety case
regime implementation are provided in Appendix C.

4.6 Regulatory Assessment, Verification, and Intervention
To effectively oversee covered facilities and enforce safety case
regulations, technically competent regulators review and
assess325 safety case reports and utilize preventative inspections
and audits to effectively intervene before high-risk activities
commence. According to the HSE, “[t]he assessment process is
only a part of the COMAH regime and examines at face value
the factual information and examines arguments and
demonstrations contained in the report against the requirements
of the regulations.”326 The HSE places great emphasis during
the assessment phase on the adoption of inherently safer
designs327 and notes that “[m]ajor accident hazards should be
avoided or reduced at source through the application of
principles of inherent safety.”328 Conclusions on the adequacy of the safety case report are developed at
the end of the assessment process, and, if deficiencies are found, an intervention strategy for the facility is
developed to addresses those deficient measures. According to the HSE, assessment of a safety case
report or document “is not a discrete activity but leads to further action under the intervention plan for the
operator at that establishment.”329 Intervention by the regulator ensures that the facility and its operations
are consistent with information provided in the safety case report, and that there are robust systems in
place to “reduce the likelihood of hazards and to mitigate their consequences until the associated risks are
ALARP.”330,331 Under the safety case regulatory regime, the regulator has the authority to accept the
safety case report or reject it and require additional measures to further reduce risks.
Preventative inspections and audits by a technically competent regulator can also result in deep challenges
to industry, which does not typically happen under the PSM or RMP regulations. In the UK, the
COMAH regulations authorize the CA to

331 According to HSE, essential considerations to ensure ALARP are “the scope of hazard elimination, the adoption
of inherently safer designs, whether good practice has been, or is to be adopted, [and] the application of risk-
reducing measures where relevant good practice is not yet established.” Ibid at 30 and 31.

Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
organize an adequate system of inspections of establishments or other
measures of control appropriate to the type of establishment
concerned…[that are] sufficient for a planned and systematic
examination of the systems being employed at the establishment,
whether of a technical, organisational or managerial nature, so as to
ensure…(a) that the operator can demonstrate that he has taken
appropriate measures to prevent major accidents; (b) that the operator
can demonstrate that he has provided appropriate means for limiting the
consequences of major accidents both inside and outside the
establishment; (c) that the information contained in any report sent to the
competent authority by the operator of the establishment adequately
reflects the conditions in the establishment…332
The CSB noted in its BP Texas City Final Investigation Report that in the UK, HSE inspectors thoroughly
inspect high hazard facilities annually, and all COMAH-covered facilities are inspected every five years.
For the approximately ten petroleum refineries in the UK, detailed planned inspections (ranging from 80
to 150 days) are conducted annually for each refinery by a multidisciplinary team (regulatory inspectors,
process safety, mechanical engineering, electrical and instrumentation, and human factors specialists).333
The HSE lists its offshore priorities as safety case assessment;334 verification;335 inspection; investigation;
and enforcement.336 In its business plan for 2012-2015, the HSE set out a goal of assessing 72 safety
cases onshore and 100 safety cases offshore for 2013 and 2014.337 The work required to assess a safety
case report both on and offshore is very resource-intensive (a typical new offshore safety case assessment
requires anywhere from 100 to 300 hours of work), and demands that the regulator hire and retain
individuals with significant oil and gas experience, specifically in areas such as process safety, human
factors, engineering, and organizational performance.
In Australia, the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 authorizes NOPSEMA to
conduct planned inspections of offshore installations to ensure compliance with the Act.338 NOPSEMA
notes that planned inspections “are a critical examination of aspects of a facility, its systems and

http://www.csb.gov/assets/1/19/CSBFinalReportBP.pdf (accessed October 29, 2013).
334 An owner or operator (i.e. the duty holder) is required to submit a safety case to HSE for each offshore
installation. HSE then assesses the safety case using both regulations and HSE’s “Assessment Principles for
Offshore Safety Cases (APOSC) and must accept it before an installation can operate. See
http://www.hse.gov.uk/offshore/aposc190306.pdf (accessed July 31, 2013).

operations with information obtained from the facility safety case.”339 Subjects of planned inspections
include risk control measures related to either a Major Accident Event340 or Occupational Health and
Safety controls, or both. NOPSEMA states that it conducts at least two per year for each normally
manned offshore installation.341 NOPSEMA distinguishes between two types of planned inspections:
field-based inspections, which focus on implementation of control measures described in a facility’s
safety case, and themed audits, which deal with inspection of organizational issues by following a
common theme to direct lines of questioning.342
In a 1992 compliance directive,343 OSHA stated that the primary enforcement model for the PSM
standard would be planned, comprehensive, and resource-intensive Program Quality Verification (PQV)
inspections.344 These inspections consist of three parts: determining if the elements of a PSM program
are in place; evaluating if the programs comply with the requirements of the standard; and verifying
compliance with the standard through interviews, data sampling, and field observations. However,
OSHA does not make planned inspections, which have the most opportunity for prevention, a high
priority. Rather, OSHA lists its inspection priorities as 1) imminent danger situations; 2) fatalities and
catastrophes; 3) complaints; 4) referrals; 5) follow-ups; and 6) planned inspections.345
The CSB noted in its BP Texas City Final Investigation Report that for the 10-year period prior to the
Texas City incident, federal OSHA had conducted no planned PQV inspections in oil refineries. As a
result, CSB recommended in its report that OSHA strengthen the planned enforcement of the OSHA
Process Safety Management (PSM) standard by developing more highly trained and experienced
inspectors to conduct more comprehensive inspections, such as the PQV audits envisioned in the 1992
directive, at facilities presenting the greatest risk of a catastrophic accident. The intent of the
recommendation was to establish a permanent, ongoing planned comprehensive inspections program.
Spurred in part by the CSB’s recommendations, OSHA issued the Petroleum Refinery Process Safety
Management National Emphasis Program (NEP) on June 7, 2007.346 The NEP was a federal program that
established guidelines for inspecting petroleum refineries to assure compliance with the PSM standard.
Unlike the PQV approach to inspections, which “employs a broad, open-ended inspection strategy and
uses a more global approach to identify compliance deficiencies…,” the NEP “provide[d] a specific tool
to evaluate compliance with the [PSM] standard…[which] identifies a particular set of requirements from
the PSM standard from which CSHOs [Compliance Safety and Health Officers] are to review documents,

interview employees, and verify implementation for specific processes, equipment, and procedures.”347
The NEP inspections were meant to be more targeted and efficient than PQV inspections. However, the
inspections being conducted pursuant to the NEP were ended in 2011 partly because they were very time-
consuming and resource-intensive.348 OSHA has publicly stated349 that NEP inspection hours were
roughly 40 times greater than average OSHA inspection hours. OSHA described the NEP as its most
effective emphasis program in its history, citing a disturbing number of issues and subsequent citations.
In 1999, EPA established an audit350 program to help ensure compliance with the RMP program. The
audits were intended to provide an independent verification of the information in the RMP and include
on-site inspections. Under these requirements, the implementing agency (EPA or a correlating state
agency) must “periodically audit” RMPs to review their adequacy and require revisions when necessary
to ensure compliance. 351
Between fiscal years (FYs) 2010 and 2012, each EPA Region responsible for implementing the RMP
program was mandated by EPA to perform inspections352 at five percent of the total number of regulated
facilities in the regions, and a certain percentage of these facilities were required to be high-risk.353 In FY

engaged in a process of trying to figure out how we will address refinery PSM issues in the future. Clearly OSHA's
past practice of targeting inspection according to injury and illness numbers is not adequate. However, because of
resource limitations, we are also unable to commit to a full-time NEP.” “Saving Lives and Transforming

350 Within Part 68, the term “audit” refers to the process that implementing agencies may use to verify the quality of
the RMP submitted to EPA and require revisions when necessary to ensure compliance. RMP audits will generally
involve on-site verification of a facility’s underlying risk management program. Section 68.220 of the RMP rule
requires implementing agencies to select facilities for audits based on specific criteria, and to follow a specific
process for resolving audit findings prior to any enforcement action. See EPA. Guidance for Conducting Risk
Management Program Inspections under Clean Air Act Section 112(r); January 2011; p 4. Available at
http://www.epa.gov/osweroe1/docs/chem/clean_air_guidance.pdf (accessed June 11, 2013).
351 40 CFR §68.220 (1999).
352 RMP inspections “are different from audits in that facilities are not necessarily selected for inspection based on
Part 68 regulatory criteria, and inspections can lead directly to implementing agency enforcement actions for
regulatory violations. Also, RMP inspections always involve on-site verification activities.” See EPA, “Guidance
for Conducting Risk Management Program Inspections under Clean Air Act Section 112(r).” January 2011; page 4.

353 Criteria used to determine high-risk includes the number of people in the footprint (if it is more than 100,000);
accidental releases reported in the RMP; the hazard index (percentage of chemical quantity above threshold and
number of chemicals onsite); and the number of Program Levels 2 or 3. US EPA Region 9 Emergency Prevention

2010, regions were to conduct 10 percent of the inspections at high-risk facilities, and in FYs 2011 and
2012, 25 percent at high-risk facilities.354
Although EPA has acknowledged that “full compliance with the Risk Management Program regulations
cannot be determined without on-site or independent verification of all or part of the information
submitted in an RMP[,]”355 the EPA has not effectively implemented the audit and inspection elements of
the Risk Management Program. As mentioned above in Section 3.2.2.3.2, the EPA Office of Inspector
General (OIG) concluded in 2009 that over half of the RMP-covered facilities identified in the US as
high-risk356 had never received an on-site inspection or audit, and over 65 percent of all active RMP
facilities had not received an on-site inspection or audit since inception of the RMP program in 1999.357
The EPA OIG also noted that of the 296 uninspected high-risk facilities managed by EPA, 151 of these
could each impact 100,000 people or more in a worst-case accident scenario.358
4.7 Independent, Competent, Well-Funded Regulator
As noted by NOPSEMA, a safety regulator “provides ‘independent’ assurance to society, governments
and industry that companies have identified the risks to health and safety and have put appropriate
measures in place to control these risks.”359 To ensure that companies are managing risks and employing
the best available standards and technologies, the regulator must be independent,360 well-resourced, and
retain a sufficient number of technically competent, experienced, and well-trained staff that can critically
assess companies’ safety case reports and performance. Without independent and competent
examinations, the safety case report becomes a meaningless document in terms of controlling risk and
preventing major accidents. Offshore regulators in the UK and Australia also utilize independent third
party specialist safety companies recognized by the regulator. Third party inspectors review important
aspects of the safety case, such as safety critical elements361 and performance standards.362 Third party
inspections, however, do not take the place of rigorous inspections by the regulator.

356 A high-risk facility is one that meets one of more of the following characteristics established by the EPA Office
of Emergency Management: 1) Facilities whose reported RMP worst-case scenario population exceeds 100,000
people; 2) Any RMP Program facility with a hazard index greater than or equal to 25; and/or 3) Facilities that have
had one or more significant accidental releases within the previous five years. See “EPA Office of Inspector

361 The UK HSE requires offshore installations to define “safety critical elements,” which are the technical barriers

Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
As of June 2012, the HSE employed roughly 3,300 staff, of which 1,381were front-line inspectors,363
whose responsibilities include conducting preventative inspections of roughly 950 COMAH facilities
throughout the UK. The HSE employs roughly 105 inspectors to inspect approximately 300 offshore
installations, in effect a one to three ratio. As such, the HSE, with a budget of roughly $472 million,364
has the authority to offer higher specialist salaries to attract and retain more experienced, competent
personnel. According to information obtained from the HSE, in 2011 and 2012 their onshore specialist
inspector pay ranged from $85,806 to $102,344, and their offshore inspector pay ranged from $134,387 to
$148,423 at the highest grade and $116,288 to $131,499 at the next highest grade.365
A safety case regime requires regulators to conduct preventative facility inspections and audits against the
safety case to ensure that specified controls are functioning as intended. Regulators must be capable of
interacting as equals with company risk managers when conducting these inspections. Former HSE staff
have communicated to the CSB that the HSE seeks new employees with good communication skills in
addition to education and experience, as the job of a safety case regulator requires encouraging companies
to aspire to make safety improvements that they may not want to make. One message that current and
former HSE staff have repeated is that the industry believes having competent regulatory staff adds
significant value to their business.366 In any country, competent offshore regulatory staff can persuade
companies to manage risks in a rigorous manner, knowing that if not done properly, their risk
management practices will be challenged.367 This competence is also essential for companies’ confidence
in the accuracy of the regulatory staff’s advice, inspections, and citations. According to a literature
review on the safety case in the UK, “[s]ome companies see as positive the requirement to have ‘someone
external to the company keeping you on your toes by regularly asking if you have done all you can,’ and
that it ‘forces you to convince yourself’ that you have covered all the risks.”368
362 In the UK, duty holders have a duty under the Offshore Installations (Safety Case) Regulations 2005 to “put in
place and keep under continual review a verification scheme by means of which assurance is obtained from an
independent competent person (ICP) that safety critical elements and PFEER [Offshore Installations ) Prevention of
Fire and Explosion, and Emergency Response] specified plant are suitable and remain suitable for the lifetime of the
installation.” See http://www.hse.gov.uk/offshore/verification.htm (accessed November 14, 2013).

364 For 2013/2014, HSE’s budget is listed as 308.1 £million. HSE recovers approximately 40 percent of its costs
through income mainly in the nuclear, offshore, and chemical sectors, and the remainder is funded from Grant-in-

Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
In the US, the federal government has used extensive resources to retain the best available talent to focus
on health and safety oversight of US commercial and defense nuclear facilities.369 For instance, many
nonsupervisory technical staff at the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission370 (NRC) and the Defense
Nuclear Facilities Safety Board are paid at the top of the General Schedule pay schedule.371 Virtually all
technical staff at the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board hold technical master’s degrees and
approximately 25 percent hold doctoral degrees.372
The federal government has a unique category of non-executive positions that involve high-level research
and development in the physical, biological, medical, or engineering sciences, or a closely-related field.373
These are known as “Scientific or Professional” positions, and they are classified above the highest
general schedule pay level.374 These special salary authorizations contribute to the technical agencies’
ability to compete with private industry to recruit and retain highly competent staff. The NRC also has a
type of funding mechanism that ensures that the agency’s budget adequately covers its regulator
activities, as the NRC is required by law to recover at least 90 percent of its budget through licensing and
inspection fees.375
Another method by which the NRC is able to attract and retain competent technical staff is its extensive
training programs. For new inspection staff, the NRC requires a series of courses, assessments, and
simulation, all of which takes approximately two years to complete.376 Inspectors must have a bachelor’s
degree in engineering or a degree in a relevant scientific field and Professional Engineer certification.377
The agency operates a technical training center in Chattanooga, Tennessee, with various control room
simulators that mirror licensees’ facilities. The NRC staff is expected to sufficiently understand this
equipment so that they are able to conduct sufficient audits and investigations.378 Before he or she is fully
qualified to conduct inspections, inspector candidates must be recommended by the NRC inspector
qualification board and certified by the regional administrator or division director.379
As will be discussed in greater detail under Section 5.0, at the time of the Chevron incident, a majority of
the regulators responsible for oversight of Chevron and other petroleum refineries in California did not
have sufficient, sustainable funding or staffing to oversee major accident prevention activities. An
effective safety case regulatory system would necessitate that the California industry regulator be well-

5.0 Oversight of Petroleum Refineries in California
In California, there currently exists a patchwork of primarily activity-based federal, state, and local laws
and regulations aimed at preventing harmful releases of hazardous materials at facilities such as
petroleum refineries. This regulatory framework does not foster continuous improvement by driving
companies to reduce risks of their hazardous activities to ALARP, nor does it have the requisite number
of regulatory staff with the skills, knowledge, and experience to provide sufficient oversight.
5.1 Cal/OSHA
5.1.1 Background Information
Section 18 of the OSHAct380 encourages states to develop and implement their own job safety and health
programs. Twenty-five states (including California), Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands currently
implement OSHA-approved State Plans.381 States must set job safety and health standards that are “at
least as effective as” comparable federal standards; most adopt standards that are identical to the federal
standards.382
California was certified as an OSHA State Plan state on August 12, 1977.383 California’s Division of
Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) administers the California Occupational Safety and Health
Program. A PSM District Office384 within Cal/OSHA enforces California’s PSM standard, which is
established under Title 8, Section 5189 of the California Code of Regulations (CCR) and entitled Process
Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials.385,386 The PSM District Office is comprised of
seven inspectors, known as Associate Safety Engineers, and one District Manager to regulate nearly 1,700
PSM-covered facilities in California, including 14 petroleum refineries. Only one of these individuals has
a technical background, with a degree in Chemical Engineering. Appendix B of this report summarizes
the key differences between the federal and California PSM standards and the safety case regulatory
regime. A more detailed analysis of those differences will be provided in the remainder of Section 5.1.
The CSB in its Interim Report identified a number of weaknesses of Chevron’s process safety
performance. In many of these causal issues, Chevron was not required to perform at a more effective
level by the existing California PSM regulations. In Table 1 below, the CSB identifies the causal issues
or findings, which highlight the gaps in the California and federal PSM regulations, and how each issue is
more effectively managed in the safety case regulatory regime. In this section of the report, some of these
examples will be examined in relation to key features of an effective regulatory approach such as the
380 29 U.S.C. §667 (2004).
381 These are referred to informally as OSHA State Plans. OSHA approves and monitors State plans and provides up
to 50 percent of an approved plan's operating costs

383 See http://www.osha.gov/dcsp/osp/stateprogs/california.html (accessed June 17, 2013).
384 The California PSM District Offices were established in 2001 after the February 1999 Tosco refinery incident in
which four workers were fatally injured following the ignition of a highly flammable material during a turnaround
operation. In January 2012 the two district offices were combined into one PSM District Office.

such as PHAs, MOCs, and
investigation activities.

5.1.2 Analysis
5.1.2.1 ALARP
Unlike the OSHAct, the California Occupational Safety and Health Act does not have a General Duty
Clause. Rather, Section 5189 was established to “eliminate to a substantial degree, the risks to which
employees are exposed in petroleum refineries, chemical plants and other facilities.”393 By focusing on
the significant reduction of risk, this language supports the principle of ALARP, which requires a
showing by the company that “there are no other practical measures that could reasonably be taken to
reduce risks further.”394 However, this section, which lays out the “scope and purpose” of the regulation,
is not an enforceable element of the regulation that is subject to citations, and the remaining PSM
regulation elements do not lead in practice to that result. Rather, California’s PSM standard has remained
activity-based, with many activity-based elements almost identical to the federal PSM standard. For
example, an employer must “perform a hazard analysis [PHA] appropriate to the complexity of the
393 8 CCR §5189 (a) (2012).
394 ALARP Guidance Note N-04-300-GN0166, Rev. 3 (Dec. 2011) available at
http://www.nopsema.gov.au/assets/document/N-04300-GN0166-ALARP.pdf (accessed May 15, 2013).

Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
process for identifying, evaluating, and controlling hazards involved in the process....”395 The PHA must
address hazards of the process; engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards and their
relationships; consequences of failure of these controls; facility siting; human factors; a qualitative
evaluation of a range of the possible safety and health effects of the failure of controls on facility
employees; and the identification of any previous incident which had a likely potential for catastrophic
consequences in the workplace.”396 This language does not support the principle of ALARP, and makes
no mention of risk or continuous improvement in any way. As a result, PHAs satisfy the California PSM
regulatory requirement by merely listing safeguards; there is no requirement to evaluate or document the
effectiveness of these safeguards, or to show that the safeguards in place are effectively reducing risks.
As discussed in the CSB’s Interim Report on the Chevron incident, Chevron cited in its 2009 crude unit
PHA non-specific, judgment-based qualitative safeguards such as: utilizing metallurgy to minimize
corrosion, having effective maintenance and inspection programs, and providing pipe wall corrosion
allowances.397 The effectiveness of these safeguards was neither evaluated nor documented. Had the
adequacy of these safeguards been verified, improved safeguards intended to protect against sulfidation-
induced failure of carbon steel piping could have been recommended. In addition, while the 4-sidecut
line was analyzed in this PHA, corrosion was not identified as a potential cause of a leak/rupture in the
piping (emphasis added). A corrosion review, also referred to as a damage mechanism hazard review,
analyzes hazards presented by all process failure mechanisms such as corrosion and cracking. This type
of review, while considered to be good practice,398 is not required by the PSM regulations either federally
or in California, and as such the CSB made a recommendation in its Interim Report to require these in
future California PHAs. Under a safety case regulatory regime, the regulator has the ability to drive
industry to adapt new technologies and safer practices as soon as they are developed; new rulemaking is
not required for immediate improvements, because companies are obligated to continually work toward
specified performance goals such as reducing risks to ALARP. Therefore, under a safety case regulatory
regime the regulator could require these types of reviews to be conducted to reduce risk without requiring
additional legislation.
Cal/OSHA does not typically review a company’s PHA as part of its routine oversight of process safety
management unless there is a specific complaint, accident, or targeted inspection. Nor does it “accept” a
company’s PHA and proposed hazard mitigations. Therefore, prior to the August 2012 incident,
Cal/OSHA inspectors did not require any additional information or analysis to be provided in the Chevron
crude unit PHA. Highlighting the reactive nature of the PSM standard, Cal/OSHA inspected the Chevron
facility post-incident and issued 17 citations related to the incident and eight additional citations, with a
total proposed fine of nearly $1 million. Only one citation related to PHAs, and it was not associated with
evaluating the effectiveness of safeguards or failure to control the 4-sidecut corrosion hazard. Rather, the
emphasis was that Chevron’s PHA did not adequately account for hazards caused by other units
395 8 CCR §5189 (e)(1) (2012).
396 8 CCR §5189 (e)(2) (A) through (G) (2012).
397 Corrosion allowance refers to extra wall thickness added as a safety factor to the design of a piece of equipment
beyond that needed solely for mechanical considerations such as design temperature and pressure. This extra
thickness is provided to accommodate for expected loss of wall thickness due to corrosion over the life of the
equipment.
398 API RP 571, Damage Mechanisms Affecting Fixed Equipment in the Refining Industry, describes common
process failure mechanism and is considered to be good practice for analyzing risks presented by process failure
mechanisms such as corrosion and cracking.
77

Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
associated with the crude unit. This again highlights the lack of a requirement for Chevron to
demonstrate that risks have been reduced to ALARP, or for Chevron to provide this type of analysis to
Cal/OSHA to review.
5.1.2.2 Adaptability and Continuous Improvement
Of the 25 Cal/OSHA citations mentioned above, two were issued to Chevron for its failure to follow API
RP 939-C, Guidelines for Avoiding Sulfidation (Sulfidic) Corrosion Failures in Oil Refineries as
RAGAGEP. This voluntary API standard will be discussed in greater detail in the CSB’s Final
Investigation Report on the Chevron incident. However, it is important to note for purposes of this report
that API RP 939-C is a permissive and voluntary standard merely intended to provide guidance to
industry personnel on how to address sulfidation corrosion in petroleum refining operations. Existing
safety guidelines use words “shall” and “should” to denote either requirements or recommendations. API
RP 939-C does not use the word “shall”; as such, it contains no requirements for industry. While the
regulator in a safety case regulatory regime has the authority to analyze and challenge the requirements of
API RP 939-C with the goal of driving continuous improvement and risk reduction (note the Buncefield
examples discussed in Section 4.3), in the present case Cal/OSHA utilized the voluntary practice as an
opportunity to issue a citation to Chevron post-incident. Cal/OSHA did not analyze API RP 939-C to
determine whether its provisions are sufficient to reduce risks and manage hazards. It also remains to be
seen whether this citation will be upheld considering the permissive language contained within the
standard.
Chevron has investigated a number of sulfidation incidents at its refineries over the years, including
Richmond, Salt Lake City, and Pascagoula. Figure 2 shows a timeline of Chevron’s key sulfidation
events. In January 2007, a failure due to sulfidation corrosion caused a serious fire in the Chevron
Richmond Refinery crude unit resulting in a CWS Level 3 alert, injuring one worker and initiating a
shelter-in-place for the surrounding community. As a result of these investigations, Chevron made
internal recommendations to require 100 percent component inspections in high-risk piping systems.
However, these recommendations were not implemented in the Richmond Refinery crude unit prior to the
incident, highlighting a lack of learning from previous incidents by Chevron.
78

In addition, as a result of the January 2007 incident, Chevron informed Contra Costa Health Services’
Hazardous Materials Program399 (CCHMP) in a letter that the crude unit piping metallurgy had been
upgraded following this incident as an inherently safer solution. However, the CSB learned that this
upgrade was limited to only the immediate piping spool400 that failed. Cal/OSHA also did not require
Chevron to update the crude unit PHA to address the findings from this incident. Under a safety case
regulatory regime, the regulator would work with the company to improve its practices following such an
incident. The company would also be required to update its safety case report to address these corrosion
hazards and demonstrate how the company has reduced risks to ALARP.
The CSB also noted in its Chevron Interim Report that despite internal recommendations to replace the
entire #4 sidecut piping with an inherently safer, more corrosion-resistant material of construction,
Chevron’s 2006 Management of Change (MOC) analysis limited the application of those
recommendations. Instead of replacing the entire piping segment identified by the original
recommendation, the 2006 MOC considered only the replacement of a small section. Although the
recommendation was intended to more broadly apply inherently safer materials of construction, the final
implementation under the 2006 MOC limited the application of this more corrosion resistant
399 Contra Costa Health Services’ Hazardous Materials program is designed to respond to emergencies and monitor
hazardous materials within Contra Costa County. See http://cchealth.org/hazmat/ (accessed April 17, 2013).
CCHSHMP also implements the CalARP and ISO programs, which will be discussed in greater detail later on.

order to provide a temporary connection or complete disconnection between two piping circuits.
79

Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
metallurgy.401 As the mere completion of an MOC and the implementation of any action item satisfy the
California PSM standard requirements, regardless of its adequacy or effectiveness, Cal/OSHA did not
evaluate the MOC or cite Chevron for narrowing the scope of the MOC, despite its disregard of internal
recommendations. Neither the California nor the federal PSM standards allow citations for inadequate
MOCs. In addition, RAGAGEP does not apply to the MOC PSM element.
This can be contrasted with the safety case regulatory regime in the UK, where the HSE includes the
adoption of inherently safer designs as an essential consideration for determining whether a duty holder
has reduced risks to ALARP.402 The HSE also notes that the guidance to COMAH Regulation 4, (the
COMAH General Duty provision) “describes the application of all measures necessary to reduce risk of a
major accident to ALARP based on a hierarchical approach (inherent safety, prevention, control,
mitigation).”403
5.1.2.3 Process Safety Indicators
As the CSB has noted in its BP Texas City Investigation Report, Chevron Interim Report, and Section 4.5
of this report, process safety indicators are a significant element of process safety management systems
and are critical for reducing process safety incidents. A major goal of process safety indicators is to drive
continuous process safety improvement. Regulators can utilize these indicators to focus inspections,
audits, and investigations.
Federally and in the state of California, neither the PSM standard nor the RMP rule require companies to
utilize or report process safety indicators. Chevron voluntarily utilizes both leading and lagging
indicators internally in its US petroleum refineries, in a system called Operational Excellence and
Reliability Intelligence (OERI), which tracks 26 different process safety indicators. OERI was
implemented in May 2009. However, Chevron is not required to report the status of its indicators to
California regulators. Nor is Chevron held accountable to use the indicators to drive performance or
continuous improvement. As a result, the CSB made a recommendation in its Chevron Interim Report to
the California State Legislature to identify and require the reporting of leading and lagging process safety
indicators to state and local regulatory agencies, with the goal of improving mechanical integrity and
process hazard analysis performance at all California petroleum refineries, and preventing major chemical
incidents.
5.1.2.4 Inspections
As noted in Section 4.6, safety case regulators utilize preventative inspections and audits to monitor
compliance with legislation and to ensure that the facility and its operations are consistent with
information provided in the safety case. However, like federal OSHA, California regulations require
Cal/OSHA to prioritize accident, complaint, and referral-based inspections over planned inspections. As
such, Cal/OSHA’s inspection program of the nearly 1,700 PSM-regulated facilities in California,
401 As discussed in the Interim Report, only the section of piping downstream of the pumps was replaced with 9-
Chrome.

including 14 petroleum refineries, 404 has been reactive in nature rather than proactive to maximize
prevention.
OSHA State Plan states405 were strongly encouraged but not required to implement the federal Petroleum
Refinery NEP. Cal/OSHA did not adopt the NEP “because of its dedicated PSM Unit.”406 Between 2006
and August 6, 2012, the Cal/OSHA PSM District Office conducted only three planned inspections of the
Chevron Richmond facility, totaling only 150 inspector hours of effort. Cal/OSHA has acknowledged
that these were not PQV inspections, as envisioned in its mission statement and in the federal PSM
compliance directive. None of these inspections resulted in citations or fines. According to statistics
provided by OSHA, federal NEP refinery inspections conducted between 2007 and the end of 2011
required roughly 1,000 inspector hours each and resulted in an average of 11.2 violations and $76,821 in
penalties per inspection. OSHA noted that hours spent on a typical federal refinery NEP inspection were
40 times greater than the average OSHA inspection. These numbers indicate a major disparity in
thoroughness and comprehensiveness between the planned inspections conducted by Cal/OSHA and the
NEP inspections conducted by OSHA and other OSHA State Plan States. The federal NEP, which
represented a more robust and intensive inspection program, ended in 2011 due to the stated great demand
on OSHA resources.
5.1.2.5 Workforce Participation
Like the federal PSM standard, California’s PSM standard provides for workforce participation in a
company’s process safety management program. 8 CCR §5189 (p) requires an employer to develop a
written plan to “ensure employee participation in process safety management” including “consultation
with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of the elements of process
safety management…”407 However, developing a written plan to satisfy the regulatory requirements does
not ensure that workers and their representatives in practice are able to effectively participate in a
company’s process safety management systems.
In its investigation of the Chevron incident, the CSB noted that the Chevron Richmond Refinery
workforce and its representatives, the United Steelworkers (USW), had expressed concerns regarding
sulfidation corrosion and broader workplace safety issues, but were not consistently listened to by
Chevron managers, and their concerns regarding corrosion were not adequately acted upon. In November
2011, Cal/OSHA investigated a complaint of unsafe working conditions during the fourth quarter
Richmond Lube Oil Plant (RLOP) turnaround at the Richmond Refinery. The RLOP receives feedstock
from the crude unit where the August 6th incident occurred and has similar sulfidation corrosion concerns.
During the shutdown of the RLOP, a fire occurred at one of the RLOP furnaces. According to
Cal/OSHA’s inspection report, Chevron employees told Cal/OSHA that “OPERATORS GET
IGNORED.” Many of the employees were concerned about increased corrosion they were finding during
the turnaround, and believed that increased temperatures and throughput rates had an adverse effect on
404 Also see the California Labor Code Sections 6309 to 6315 (The California Occupational Safety and Health Act of
1973).
405 Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 encourages States to develop and operate their
own job safety and health programs, referred to informally as an OSHA State Plan. OSHA approves and monitors
State plans and provides up to 50 percent of an approved plan's operating costs.

equipment integrity. According to the interview notes, many operators had raised issues of corrosion in
the RLOP to higher level supervisors to no avail; according to one, if you raise an issue a couple of times,
“you get labeled a ‘pest.’” The CSB has not identified evidence indicating that Cal/OSHA took further
action to respond to these concerns, and Cal/OSHA did not issue any citations as a result of its
investigation.408 Post-incident, significant sulfidation corrosion was found in the RLOP and piping and
equipment were replaced.
The CSB found other significant evidence that increased workforce participation could have reduced the
likelihood that unchecked corrosion would lead to the August 2012 incident. As discussed in the CSB’s
Interim Report on the Chevron incident, Chevron technical staff has considerable knowledge and
expertise regarding sulfidation corrosion, specifically with respect to corrosion rate variations caused by
differing silicon concentration in carbon steel piping. Chevron employees have authored industry papers
on sulfidation corrosion and had significant influence in the development of the industry sulfidation
corrosion recommended practice, API RP 939-C. In 2009, Chevron Energy Technology Company
(Chevron ETC)409 created an internal document on the subject of sulfidation corrosion. Chevron ETC
metallurgists released a formal report dated September 30, 2009 (nearly 3 years prior to the incident) to
Chevron refinery-based reliability managers and chief inspectors entitled Updated Inspection Strategies
for Preventing Sulfidation Corrosion Failures in Chevron Refineries.
Sulfidation experts explained in the Chevron ETC report that, “[u]ntil now, Chevron has not directly
addressed the risk of low Si[licon] carbon steel…”410 and that the report introduced a program that “seeks
to close these gaps, and to maximize the effectiveness of our inspection.” The report clearly indicates that
Chevron understood both the potential consequence and the high likelihood of a rupture or catastrophic
failure from sulfidation corrosion and calls out Chevron’s need for action.
The Chevron ETC report specifically recommended that inspectors perform 100 percent component
inspection on high temperature carbon steel piping susceptible to sulfidation corrosion. However, this
100 percent component inspection program was not implemented at the Richmond refinery prior to the
August 6, 2012, incident. The Chevron ETC report defined a priority ranking system to help focus the
inspection implementation efforts. The process conditions of the 4-sidecut pipe placed it in the highest
priority for inspection.
Chevron ETC technical experts issued a corporate newsletter in 2010 that again warned of the potential
consequence of sulfidation failures. In this newsletter, the 100 percent component inspection
recommendation from the 2009 report was reiterated for piping systems such as the crude unit 4-sidecut
piping. The newsletter stated:
Sulfidation corrosion failures … are of great concern because of the
comparatively high likelihood of ‘blowout’ or catastrophic failure. This
typically happens because corrosion occurs at a relatively uniform rate
over a broad area, so a pipe can get progressively thinner until it actually
bursts rather than leaking at a pit or local thin area. In addition, the
408 Post-incident, there were significant mechanical integrity improvements and piping replaced in the RLOP unit.
409 The Chevron Energy Technology Company is a separate business unit within the Chevron Corporation that
provides technology solutions and technical expertise for Chevron operations worldwide. See
http://richmond.chevron.com/home/aboutchevronrichmond.aspx (accessed April 4, 2013).
410 A 2003 corporate technical newsletter recommended 100 percent component inspection of carbon steel piping
susceptible to sulfidation corrosion following a 2002 Chevron Salt Lake City sulfidation corrosion incident.
82

Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
process fluid is often above its auto ignition temperature. The
combination of these factors means that sulfidation corrosion failures
frequently result in large fires. Chevron and the industry have
experienced numerous failures from this mechanism and recent incidents
have reinforced the need for revised inspection strategies and a robust
PMI (Positive Materials Identification) program.
The Chevron ETC 100 percent component inspection recommendation for high risk piping systems,
established in 2009, was not implemented at Richmond, and the thin-walled low silicon 4-sidecut piping
component remained in service until it catastrophically failed on August 6, 2012.
Chevron and Chevron ETC metallurgists, materials engineers, and piping inspectors had expertise
regarding sulfidation corrosion. They educated personnel and advocated for identification and control of
damage mechanisms, including sulfidation corrosion. However, they had limited practical influence to
implement their recommendations. These individuals did not participate in the crude unit PHA and did
not affect decisions concerning control of sulfidation corrosion during the crude unit turnaround
process.411
Despite the history of sulfidation corrosion incidents and the recommendations by Chevron’s workforce
to implement better inspection methodologies, Cal/OSHA did not evaluate these recommendations or
determine whether Chevron management ensured that the hazards of this damage mechanism were
addressed and mitigated in Chevron’s PHAs. In addition, Cal/OSHA issued no citations to Chevron post-
incident regarding the failure to address sulfidation corrosion in its crude unit PHA. Finally, when
Chevron employees raised concerns, Cal/OSHA did not effectively address them. The examples
highlighted in this section speak to the need for California to develop more effective regulation similar to
the UK legislation discussed in Section 4.4, to ensure strong workforce involvement in health and safety
matters at petroleum refineries. This will not only help prevent incidents such as the one that occurred at
Chevron, but it will also help improve communication and ensure that workers are represented in the
decisions that affect them.
5.1.2.6 Funding and Regulator Competency
Cal/OSHA has not received sufficient funding to employ a well-staffed, multi-disciplinary team capable
of conducting thorough inspections of PSM-covered facilities in California. This is apparent when
examining the lack of preventative, planned inspections of petroleum refineries being conducted by the
PSM team in the state. In order for a safety regulatory regime to successfully regulate with the goal of
major accident prevention, there must be a technically competent, well-resourced regulator in place to
sufficiently review, scrutinize, and challenge the hazard identification and evaluation that has been
conducted and controls that have been put in place to reduce risk, to help drive continuous improvement
and ensure that risks are being controlled. It is not an acceptable outcome for society that petroleum
refineries with the potential for catastrophic accidents be inspected only after an accident occurs or a
complaint is filed.
411 The turnaround process includes both the planning stage prior to the shutdown and the activities staged during the
shutdown.
83

Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
Compensation is one important factor for recruiting and retaining technically competent personnel. The
CSB found that California regulators are significantly less compensated when compared to their industry
counterparts. Based on information Chevron provided to the CSB, the average annual salary of refinery
personnel who would interact with a California regulator performing an audit or safety inspection is
$187,630. Table 2 below provides the 2012 salaries of California regulatory personnel that the CSB
determined would likely perform a safety inspection or a hypothetical safety case assessment. These
figures indicate a substantial compensation gap between the regulator and the regulated. A Cal/OSHA
PSM team of associate safety engineers receive an average annual salary that is 46 percent lower than the
refinery employees they would likely interface with during an inspection. EPA RMP inspectors receive
an annual salary that is 33 percent lower than their facility counterparts and Contra Costa County
accidental release prevention engineers and their supervisor are paid 48 percent less than these industry
personnel.412
Entity Average Annual Salary
Refinery Personnel $187,630
Cal/OSHA $100,536
Contra Costa County $96,875
EPA $125,000
Table 2. Average 2012 salary for individuals selected by the CSB as representative of the
professional staff within each California regulator and of the refinery professional staff who interface
with the regulators regarding audits or safety inspections at the Chevron Richmond Refinery.
As noted in the introduction of this report, the California State Legislature approved a 2013-2014 state
budget bill (AP 110) that allows the California Department of Industrial Relations to charge state
petroleum refineries a fee by March 31, 2014, to support an increase in funding and to pay for at least 15
new positions in Cal/OSHA’s PSM Unit.413 The CSB considers this to be a positive step towards
improving process safety management in the state of California, as it will provide the team the
opportunity to conduct more thorough inspections. However, it is imperative that these additional
inspectors have the skills, knowledge, and experience to provide sufficient direct oversight over PSM-
covered facilities. Despite the additional funding, there remains a longstanding salary cap on associate
safety engineers within Cal/OSHA. This will continue to make it difficult for Cal/OSHA to consistently
attract or retain the necessary talent and expertise to effectively oversee these facilities.
412 Compensation information is based on salary only. It does not take into account non-salary information such as
bonuses, retirement programs, or benefit programs.

5.2 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
According to the EPA OIG, as of May 2012, only eight states and five local agencies had accepted full or
partial RMP program delegation from EPA.414 As such, EPA regions directly implement the RMP
program in most states. As no state agency has requested or received delegation to implement the RMP
program within EPA Region 9, the federal EPA regional office is responsible for RMP program
implementation for California as well as Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii, the Pacific Islands, and 148 Tribal
Nations.
5.2.1 Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program
As of March 2013, there were 1,137 RMP-covered facilities in Region 9: 957 in California; 118 in
Arizona; 42 in Nevada; 16 in Hawaii; and four in Guam.415 The Chevron Richmond Refinery has many
processes covered by the RMP rule, including Program 3 processes, 416 such as the crude unit. As such,
Chevron is required to submit an RMP every five years to EPA Region 9, and EPA is expected to audit
the facility against this RMP to ensure compliance. According to Chevron’s most recent RMP submitted
to EPA Region 9 in October 2011, its crude unit contained 400,000 pounds of a flammable mixture of
propane, pentane, butane, ethane, and methane, well above the 10,000-pound threshold quantity for
flammables.417
EPA Region 9 employs four full-time and two part-time RMP inspectors to implement the RMP program
for the roughly 1,100 RMP-covered facilities in the entire region. Region 9 staff informed the EPA OIG
that to most effectively utilize their resources, they “place an additional focus on facilities in States, such
as Arizona, that do not have their own risk management or accident prevention programs.418 The EPA’s
mandates to conduct a certain number of inspections at high-risk facilities plus a lack of resources and
staffing prevent the inspectors from fully auditing many of the petroleum refineries in each state; thus, the
inspectors aim to visit each refinery every three years, where they pick one process to evaluate for two to
three days. These inspectors target their inspections towards a specific industry issue during these visits.
For example, when they last inspected Chevron in 2010, the inspectors focused on the issue of high
temperature hydrogen attack (HTHA) due to the Tesoro incident that occurred in April 2010.419

fatalities at the Tesoro Anacortes Refinery in Anacortes, Washington. The CSB is set to release its investigation
report on this incident near the end of January 2014.
85

Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
5.2.2 Implementation of the RMP Program
In order for a safety regime to function well, there must be a competent, well-resourced regulator in place
to implement the regime. However, the EPA Region 9 RMP group is extremely understaffed and under-
resourced, as there are only six full-time inspectors to cover over 1,100 facilities across many states.
Instead of fully inspecting or auditing petroleum refineries, the group is able to inspect one process at
each refinery for two to three days every three years, which makes fully inspecting these facilities or
auditing against the RMPs submitted by these facilities impossible. In addition, this group has other
responsibilities beyond the RMP program, including the management of contracts, emergency prevention
and preparedness training and outreach, and reporting violations under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). The CSB has learned that because this group
has such limited resources, it hopes to delegate RMP inspection authority to other agencies throughout the
region, as long as it maintains power to enforce violations.
Like the federal and California PSM standards, the RMP regulations provide for workforce
participation420 and require facilities to prepare a written plan of action regarding employee participation.
It is the RMP program’s policy to invite employee representatives to participate in all parts of onsite
inspections. EPA Region 9 RMP staff told the CSB, however, that the limited amount of time they were
able to spend onsite at refineries made speaking with facility inspectors and operators a difficult task.
They expressed that a lesson learned from the Chevron incident was that EPA RMP inspectors should
commit more time onsite during facility inspections and audits, which will allow them more time to speak
with workers to gain a better insight into how any issues within the facility are being addressed and
resolved.421
As mentioned above, EPA guidance on the RMP program states that the owner or operator’s duty to
“prevent accidents and ensure safety at [their] source…” may require steps to be taken “beyond those
specified in the risk management program rule.”422 While this principle appears to be similar to ALARP
requirements of the safety case, in practice this is not required, and whether this is done is not subject to
regulation or review. Similar to the PSM standard, RMP regulations require each facility with Program 3
processes to conduct a PHA as part of its prevention program that is “appropriate to the complexity of the
process…and[] identify, evaluate, and control the hazards involved in the process.”423 However, these
regulations do not require facilities to include these analyses in the RMPs they submit to EPA. Rather,
facilities with Program 2 or 3 processes are only required to include in the RMP very high-level,
simplified information on their prevention programs and their PHAs. The Chevron Richmond Refinery’s
most recent RMP submission from October 2011 included the following information on the PHAs for
each relevant process: the date of the last PHA for that process; what technique was used; what major
hazards were identified; what process controls were in use (i.e. automatic shutoffs, interlocks, alarms,
emergency power); what mitigation systems were in use (i.e. dikes, fire walls, water curtain); what
monitoring/detection systems were in use (i.e. process area detectors); date of the most recent review or
420 See 40 CFR §68.83 (2000).
421 This need for greater interface with worker is a professional opinion by EPA staff, but has not resulted in EPA
policy modifications to ensure effective worker input in future inspections.

revision of training programs; and maintenance. Chevron included one paragraph entitled “E.5. General
Accidental Release Prevention Program,” which stated that PSM is applied to the entire refinery, and the
PSM program is documented in Refinery Instruction (RI)-360, “Richmond Refinery PSM Policy.” No
additional information or analysis could be located concerning the identification or control of hazards, or
risk reduction, as, unlike the safety case model, there is no requirement for the company to demonstrate to
the regulator that it is effectively ensuring that the safety systems are functioning as intended.
Under the EPA RMP program, there is no regulatory requirement to reduce risks to ALARP. In addition,
there is no requirement to submit to the regulator detailed information relating to risk reduction or hazard
assessments. Finally, the Region 9 EPA RMP inspection team does not have the resources to fully audit
petroleum refineries and other high hazard facilities subject to the RMP program. As a result, the EPA
RMP program is not comprehensive or rigorous enough to control major accident hazards and reduce
risks. Instead, facilities submit high-level summary information providing evidence that the activity-
based requirements contained within the RMP regulations have been completed by the facility.
5.3 Unified Program
Chevron’s Richmond refinery was also subject to process safety regulatory requirements at the county
and city level. The facility had to adhere to additional requirements above the PSM and RMP regulations,
but these requirements were not sufficient to prevent the Chevron incident. The following sections will
discuss those county and city requirements.
In 1993, Chapter 418, Statutes of 1993 (Senate Bill 1082) established Chapter 6.11 of the California
Health and Safety Code (HSC), which required the Secretary of the California Environmental Protection
Agency (Cal/EPA) to adopt regulations creating a “unified hazardous waste and hazardous materials
management” regulatory program, or Unified Program, by January 1, 1996, to consolidate and make
consistent six existing hazardous materials and hazardous waste programs within the state.424 The
Secretary of Cal/EPA was charged with ensuring that the Unified Program was established and
implemented by a Certified Unified Program Agency, or CUPA, in all counties in California. Cal/EPA
adopted the Unified Program regulations under Title 27, Division 1 of the California Code of Regulations,
which integrated six existing programs: the Hazardous Waste Generator and Onsite Hazardous Waste
Treatment programs; the Aboveground Storage Tank program; the Underground Storage Tank program;
the Hazardous Materials Release Response Plans and Inventory program; the California Accidental
Release Prevention (CalARP) program; and the California Uniform Fire Code.425 The CalARP program,
which was created through Assembly Bill AB1889 with the goal of major accident prevention, will be
discussed at greater length below. There are currently 83 CUPAs in the state of California that implement
the Unified Program at a local level.426
5.3.1.1 Contra Costa County Hazardous Materials Programs
The Chevron Richmond Refinery is located in the City of Richmond, within Contra Costa County. The
local CUPA responsible for implementing the Unified Program in all areas of the country is the Contra
424 California Health and Safety Code §25404(b) (1993). Also see

Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
Costa Health Services’ Hazardous Materials Programs (CCHMP).427 CCHMP is responsible for
implementing the Unified Program in all areas of Contra Costa County.
CCHMP implements two programs that are relevant to this investigation: the CalARP program and the
City of Richmond Industrial Safety Ordinance (RISO). CCHMP also implements the county’s own
Industrial Safety Ordinance (ISO), which covers seven facilities. CCHMP has five full-time engineers,
known as accidental release prevention engineers, who are responsible for implementing these programs
for the county. While all have technical degrees in engineering, only two of these engineers have past
refinery experience.
5.3.1.1.1 CalARP
The California Health and Safety Code Article 2 (Chapter 6.95, Sections 25531 – 25543.3) was amended
effective January 1, 1997, to implement EPA’s RMP program at the state level through the creation of the
CalARP program regulations. Modeled after EPA’s RMP program and California’s Risk Management
and Prevention Plan, which was enacted in 1986, the CalARP regulations (Title 19, Chapter 4.5 of the
CCR) were implemented with the goal of preventing accidental releases of substances that can cause
serious harm to the public and the environment, minimizing damage caused by a release, and to satisfy
community right-to-know laws.428 California is one of at least three states that implement a state RMP
program without delegation of the federal program from EPA.429
The CalARP regulations, including PHA requirements, are essentially duplicative in nature to EPA’s
RMP program, with a few exceptions: the list of toxic chemicals covered is 276 instead of 77; the
threshold quantities of some chemicals are smaller; CalARP requires a seismic analysis; and there is more
interaction with the public and other agencies.430 The CalARP regulations require that businesses that
produce, handle, process, distribute, or store certain chemicals over a certain threshold quantity develop a
Risk Management Plan (RMP) and submit the RMP to a local CUPA for review. Like the EPA RMP
program, facilities with a Program 3 process must develop a management system that includes a PHA and
emergency response program.431 State oversight authority and responsibility for the CalARP program is
with the California Emergency Management Agency.432
The CalARP regulations apply to roughly 45 facilities in Contra Costa County, including the Chevron
refinery in Richmond. Each covered facility is required to submit an updated RMP to CCHMP at least
once every five years.433 The group of CCHMP engineers reviews these plans and is required to

monitoring hazardous materials in Contra Costa County. It is the duty of CCC to safeguard the Contra Costa
County ecosystem from the release of hazardous materials and other pollutants. For more information see

“periodically audit RMPs”434 against the regulations to ensure compliance. This group has told the CSB
that it audits each facility at least once every three years. It last audited Chevron in February 2011, and
has been conducting another audit in October and November 2013.
Although CCHMP is authorized to issue enforcement actions for violations uncovered during facility
audits, in practice CCHMP engineers issue “ensure” action items that list the deficiencies and recommend
improvements. They then work with the facility to make sure that these action items are implemented.
CCHMP has rarely issued fines or citations to facilities for violations. If the engineers identify other gaps
or areas for improvement that are not actual regulatory violations, they can issue “consider” action items,
which are essentially suggestions to the facility for improvements that are not technically required to be
implemented by the regulation. Whether these types of action items are issued is dependent upon the
knowledge and experience of the engineer conducting the audit. Once CCHMP engineers have
completed the audit, CCHMP issues a final audit report on the facility, which they also supply to
Cal/OSHA’s PSM District Office and the EPA Region 9 RMP group.
5.3.1.1.2 Industrial Safety Ordinance
The Contra Costa County Industrial Safety Ordinance (ISO) became effective January 15, 1999. Adopted
as County Ordinance Chapter 450-8, the ISO expands on the CalARP program in Contra Costa County
for facilities meeting the following criteria: 1) the facility is within an unincorporated area of the County;
2) the facility is either a petroleum refinery or chemical plant; 3) the facility is required to submit a Risk
Management Plan (RMP) to the EPA and the Contra Costa County Health Service; and 4) the facility has
at least one Program 3 process.435 Seven of the 45 CalARP facilities in the county are currently required
to comply with the ISO requirements.
The ISO was adopted to improve industrial safety by, among other things, requiring more comprehensive
coverage of the whole facility rather than only certain processes; providing review, inspection, auditing
and safety requirements more stringent than are currently in effect; requiring the development and
implementation of a human factors program; and preventing and reducing the number, frequency and
severity of accidental releases in Contra Costa County.436
Facilities subject to the ISO are essentially required to treat every process as subject to the CalARP
Program 3 prevention program requirements. Covered facilities have additional requirements as well,
including developing and implementing a human factors program, considering inherently safer
technologies and systems for new and existing facilities or processes, submitting a safety plan to
CCHMP, and conducting a Management of Organizational Change (MOOC) prior to changes in
permanent staffing levels or reorganization in operations, maintenance, health and safety, or emergency
response.437

Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
5.3.1.1.3 City of Richmond Industrial Safety Ordinance
On December 18, 2001, the City of Richmond adopted an Industrial Safety Ordinance (RISO) under
Municipal Code Chapter 6.43 that was almost identical to the ISO. In February 2013, the City of
Richmond Council amended the RISO to make it equivalent to the ISO. Chevron is one of two facilities
subject to RISO requirements. Pursuant to an agreement with the City of Richmond, CCHMP
implements and enforces the RISO within the city.
Like the ISO, the RISO requires that a covered facility submit a safety plan to CCHMP that includes
safety elements such as process safety information (PSI), operating procedures, mechanical integrity,
employee participation, and management of change (MOC).438 CCHMP has posted a Safety Plan
Guidance Document on its website to assist facilities in developing these plans. Each facility is also
required to comply with safety requirements including performing PHAs, and must include a description
of the manner of compliance with these in the safety plan.439 In performing a PHA, facilities are required
to address the hazards of the process, identify any previous incident, identify controls applicable to the
hazards, and identify consequences of failure of those controls, human factors, and a qualitative
evaluation of a range of possible safety and health effects of failure of controls.440
The CCHMP engineers are required to review each facility’s safety plan as well as audit each facility to
determine compliance with ISO or RISO. CCHMP engineers conduct the CalARP and ISO/RISO audits
concurrently at each covered facility. CCHMP generally audits each facility once every three years. To
aid in the auditing process, CCHMP engineers have entered all the CalARP program requirements into a
database. They have taken each of these requirements and turned them into questions. When the
engineers go onsite, they perform three main functions: 1) they identify and review any policy statement
that directs how people should handle a particular piece of equipment; 2) they identify and review records
of procedures, such as MOCs and permits; and 3) they randomly select and interview individuals about
their familiarity with various aspects of different programs. If the engineers find a regulatory deficiency,
they issue an ensure action item to the facility.
Once the engineers have completed their facility audit, they issue a preliminary determination to the
facility. The facility has 90 days to review the draft and provide a proposed remedy with specifics on
how they will fix each deficiency, and the timeline. Once the report is finalized it goes out for public
comment. Following public comment, it is issued to the facility and provided to Cal/OSHA’s PSM
District Office and the EPA Region 9 RMP group.
5.3.1.2 Analysis
Chevron submitted its most updated safety plan to CCHMP on February 25, 2013. Section 3.12 of the
plan discusses PHAs and Action Items. Under this section, Chevron lists eight objectives of its PHAs,
including identifying possible failures or releases, evaluating potential consequences, and proposing
recommendations that would reduce the risks. Chevron also discusses its possible justifications for
declining recommendations from PHAs, including the fact that an alternative measure would be
sufficient, and that the recommendation may be infeasible. There was no additional information or

439 Ibid at Sections (a) through (e) (2013).
440 Ibid at (d) (2013).
90

Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
analysis contained in this section concerning the identification or control of hazards, or risk reduction, as
there is no requirement to do so.
The RISO and CalARP regulations require that PHAs list controls and possible consequences of failure of
those controls, but there is no specific requirement to include evaluations of the safeguards and controls in
the PHA. As CCHMP engineers are only required to audit against the regulatory requirements, they
would only examine the evaluation of safeguards if such an evaluation were performed and documented
in the facility’s PHAs. As noted previously, Chevron’s most recent crude unit PHA ineffectively listed
qualitative safeguards for corrosion and mechanical integrity.
While CCHMP engineers are able to issue “consider” action items to the facility recommending actions
above and beyond regulatory requirements, CCHMP engineers did not do this regarding Chevron’s Crude
Unit PHA or its evaluation of safeguards. After reviewing CCHMP’s most recent audit of Chevron, the
CSB could find nothing referring to sulfidation corrosion, reduction of risk, or safeguard evaluation.
While CCHMP is able to utilize these “consider” action items to encourage facilities to go above and
beyond regulatory requirements to reduce risk, CCHMP engineers have stated to the CSB that they do not
make sufficient use of this mechanism. Rather, they tend to audit against the existing regulatory
requirements to ensure compliance.
Unlike the safety case regulatory approach, which requires a reduction of risk to ALARP or equivalent,
facilities covered by RISO or ISO are only required to “consider [emphasis added] the use of inherently
safer systems in the development and analysis of mitigation items resulting from a process hazard
analysis [PHA] and in the design and review of new processes and facilities.”441 Despite multiple internal
recommendations to replace its piping due to the risk of sulfidation corrosion, Chevron failed to replace
the piping prior to the incident with an inherently safer material. Again, the CSB has not found evidence
that CCHMP effectively encouraged Chevron to go above and beyond regulatory requirements by
utilizing inherently safer systems to reduce risk.
As emphasized repeatedly in this report, a regulatory regime is only as strong as its regulators, and must
employ individuals with the requisite skills, knowledge, and experience to provide sufficient oversight
over facilities. In the case of CCHMP, there are only five engineers for nearly 45 facilities in the county,
and only two have previous refinery experience.442 In addition, while the CCHMP is funded mostly
through CUPA fees, ISO fees, and other means of cost recovery, the engineers are part of a bargaining
unit and their salaries are paid through the county’s general fund, which has experienced annual budget
reductions in the millions.443 This has unnecessarily resulted in a decrease in the CCHMP engineers’
salaries and has made it extremely difficult for CCHMP to fill a current position that has been open over
three years because of its inability to offer competitive salaries to attract its engineers. Overall, CCHMP
suffers from a lack of resources and funding, limiting its ability to hire additional highly qualified staff to
oversee the petroleum refineries in Contra Costa County.
441 City of Richmond Municipal Code §6.43.050(g) (February 5, 2013).
442 Two of the other engineers have chemical plant experience and have led or participated in refinery compliance
audits in the past ten years.

Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
6.0 Conclusion
This report has focused on several attributes of more robust process safety management regulatory
regimes from around the world that the CSB believes would greatly enhance existing federal and
California process safety regulations. Some attributes discussed include: an enhanced process hazard
analysis; continuous risk reduction to ALARP; active workforce participation; the effective use of process
safety indicators that drive performance; regulatory assessment, verification, and intervention; and an
independent, competent, well-funded regulator. These attributes together enable industry and the
regulator to ensure that facilities are developing and implementing comprehensive, robust safety
management systems to prevent major accidents.
Implementation of a more comprehensive process safety management regulatory approach in California
for petroleum refineries will require a commitment of extensive resources to fund a regulator that has the
requisite skills, knowledge, and experience to ensure petroleum refineries in the state continually assess
their practices and reduce risks to ALARP. However, the CSB believes that effective implementation of
this regulatory approach will achieve greater major accident prevention in California and, in the process,
provide greater protection for its workers and the public.
An enhanced process safety management regulatory model provides the adaptability necessary to keep
current with improving standards and advancing technology, without requiring lengthy and often
unproductive rulemaking on the part of the regulator. A competent regulator will independently ensure
that California refineries have taken all practical measures that can be reasonably taken to reduce risks.
For example, the regulator would have the ability to work with these facilities to implement
recommendations and lessons learned from significant petroleum refinery incidents throughout the world
without requiring extensive rulemaking or legislation, as regulators have done post-incident in the UK,
Norway, and Australia. (Additional information and discussion of the safety case type regime is included
in Appendix C).

7.0 Process Safety Management Reform at the Federal Level: A
Path Forward
As this report discusses, process safety management in the US has undergone little reform since its
inception in the 1990s despite advancing best practices and technology. On July 25, 2013, the CSB held a
public meeting to discuss the status of three key CSB safety recommendations made to OSHA in the last
decade to revise and improve the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.444 While acknowledging
some positive steps taken by OSHA, such as including process safety management in its regulatory
agenda, the CSB expressed at the meeting its disappointment with OSHA’s lack of progress with
implementation of open CSB recommendations to improve the PSM standard.445 As a result of the
meeting, the Board voted to change the status of the three recommendations made to OSHA concerning
the PSM standard to “Open-Unacceptable”.446
Recent significant incidents such as the April 2013 explosion and fire that occurred at a fertilizer storage
and distribution facility in West, Texas, and resulted in fifteen fatalities and hundreds of injuries, have
resulted in an increased national dialogue on the issue of process safety management reform.447 As
mentioned in Section 2.0 above, President Obama has issued a number of Executive Orders focused on
improving chemical safety in the US. On January 18, 2011, President Obama issued Executive Order
13563,448 which called for improvements in the nation’s regulatory system to promote predictability and
reduce uncertainty and to use the best, most innovative, and least burdensome tools for achieving
regulatory ends.
444 The CSB made a fourth recommendation (2001-01-H-R1) to OSHA in its 2002 reactive hazards study to modify
the PSM standard to more comprehensively manage reactive hazards. On January 28, 2004, the Board voted
unanimously to designate the status of this recommendation as “Open-Unacceptable”.
445 For a copy of the public meeting transcript see http://www.csb.gov/assets/1/7/0725CSB-OSHA_(2).pdf (accessed
October 27, 2014).
446 “Open-Unacceptable” means that the recommendation recipient responds by expressing disagreement with the
need outlined in the recommendation. The Board believes, however, that there is enough supporting evidence to ask
the recipient to reconsider. The three open recommendations concerning the PSM standard are: 1)
Recommendation to ensure coverage under the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard for atmospheric storage
tanks that could be involved in a potential catastrophic release as a result of being interconnected to a covered
process with 10,000 pounds of a flammable substance. The recommendation was issued in 2002 following the
CSB’s investigation of a 2001 explosion of a poorly maintained, corroded storage tank containing spent sulfuric
acid and flammable hydrocarbons at the Motiva refinery in Delaware City, Delaware. A worker was conducting
hot work which ignited vapor through holes in the deteriorated tank. 2) Recommendation to revise the PSM
standard to require management of change (MOC) reviews for organizational changes such as mergers and
acquisitions that may impact process safety. This recommendation, issued in 2007, followed the 2005 explosions
and fire at the BP Texas City refinery which killed 15 workers and injured 180 others. 3) Recommendation that
OSHA issue a fuel gas safety standard for construction and general industry. This recommendation, issued in June
2010 followed two catastrophic accidents that occurred that year: In one, an explosion caused a roof collapse at the
ConAgra Slim Jim facility in Garner, North Carolina, killing four workers and injuring 67 others. A worker had
been attempting to purge new natural gas piping during the installation of an industrial water heater, resulting in a
large release of natural gas indoors. In the other, at the Kleen Energy power plant in Middletown, Connecticut, high
pressure natural gas was being used to clean new piping and was released in a congested outdoor area. It ignited,
killing six workers and injuring at least 50.

Following the incident in West, Texas, President Obama issued Executive Order 13650, Improving
Chemical Facility Safety and Security , on August 1, 2013.449 The Executive Order established the
Chemical Facility Safety and Security Working Group, a working group of federal agencies450 tasked
with, among other things, developing options for enhancing and modernizing policies, regulations, and
standards to improve the safety and security of chemical facilities.451, 452
Consistent with Executive Order 13650, both OSHA and the EPA issued Requests for Information, or
RFIs, in the last year, requesting comment on potential revisions to several standards, including the
Process Safety Management (Standard) and the Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program regulations,
respectively.453 These are all positive steps toward significant improvements in process safety
management at the federal level. CSB Chairperson Rafael Moure-Eraso has publicly advocated for
Executive Order 13650 implementation, including requirements for safer technologies, regulation of
reactive chemicals like the ammonium nitrate stored at West's fertilizer site, public reporting of process
safety indicators, and regulatory coverage for hazardous oil drilling and production operations.454
The CSB believes that it is important to continue to build upon this significant national dialogue. In the
coming months, the CSB will consider adding the issue of federal process safety management reform and
modernization to its Most Wanted Chemical Safety Improvements Program (“Most Wanted Program”).455
The purpose of the Most Wanted Program is to:
• identify the most important chemical safety improvement goals of the CSB in the form of a “Most
Wanted List” of Chemical Safety Improvements, which will be based on recommendations
resulting from CSB investigations, studies, hearings, and similar fact-finding activities;

• make efficient use of limited resources to pursue implementation of changes that are most likely
to achieve important national-level safety improvements;
• focus special advocacy efforts by Board Members and staff on the Most Wanted List;
• inform the CSB’s deployment decisions and strategic allocation of staff resources; and
• issue periodic reports of the activities of the Program.
Consistent with Executive Order 13650, the CSB will also hold a public hearing to discuss the need for
process safety management regulatory reform at the federal level. The public hearing will include
discussion of various models for high hazard facility safety regulation from around the US and the world
– including consideration of safety case type models. Presentations, or written comments, regarding
various regimes should discuss, at a minimum, the following:
• The role of transparency and community involvement;
• The effectiveness of worker (union and non-union) involvement programs and the effectiveness
of protecting workers from retaliatory actions;
• The methods for measuring process safety performance and for reporting of process safety
indicator data (to regulators, the public, third parties, or industry groups);
• The approach used to strive for risk reduction and continuous improvement;
• The approach for establishing a “tolerable” risk level; and
• The effectiveness of enforcement methods.
The CSB will hold this public hearing in the Spring of 2015, following the publication of this
report. Upon completion of the public hearing the CSB will publish a document summarizing
the proceedings.

8.0 Recommendations
Pursuant to its authority under 42 U.S.C. §7412(r)(6)(C)(i) and (ii), and in the interest of promoting safer
operations at California petroleum refineries and protecting workers and communities from future
accidents, the CSB makes the following safety recommendations:
California State Legislature,
Governor of California
2012-03-I-CA-R21
Based on the findings in this report, enhance and restructure California’s process safety management
(PSM) regulations for petroleum refineries by including the following goal-setting attributes:
a. Require a comprehensive process hazard analysis (PHA) written by the company that includes:
i. Systematic analysis and documentation of all major hazards and safeguards, using the
hierarchy of controls to identify hazards and significantly reduce risks to a goal of as low as
reasonably practicable (ALARP) or similar;
ii. Documentation of the recognized methodologies, rationale and conclusions used to claim that
inherently safer systems have been implemented to as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP) or
similar, and that additional safeguards intended to control remaining hazards will be effective;
iii. Documented damage mechanism hazard review conducted by a diverse team of qualified
personnel. This review shall be an integral part of the process hazard analysis (PHA) cycle and
shall be conducted on all covered processes, piping circuits and equipment. The damage
mechanism hazard review shall identify potential process damage mechanisms and consequences
of failure, and shall ensure effective safeguards are in place to prevent or control hazards
presented by those damage mechanisms. Require the analysis and incorporation of applicable
industry best practices and inherently safer design to the greatest extent feasible into this review;
and
iv. Documented use of inherently safer systems analysis and the hierarchy of controls to the
greatest extent feasible in establishing safeguards for identified process hazards. The goal shall
be to drive the risk of major accidents to As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) or similar.
Include requirements for inherently safer systems analysis to be automatically triggered for all
management of change (MOC) and process hazard analysis (PHA) reviews, as well as prior to the
construction of new processes, process unit rebuilds, significant process repairs, and in the
development of corrective actions from incident investigation recommendations.
96

Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
b. Require a thorough review of the comprehensive process hazard analysis by technically competent
regulatory personnel;
c. Require preventative audits and preventative inspections by the regulator to ensure the effective
implementation of the comprehensive process hazard analysis (PHA);
d. Require that all safety codes, standards, employer internal procedures and recognized and generally
accepted good engineering practices (RAGAGEP) used in the implementation of the regulations contain
adequate minimum requirements;
e. Require mechanisms for the regulator, the refinery, and workers and their representatives to play an
equal and essential role in the direction of preventing major incidents. Require an expanded role for
workers in management of process safety by establishing the rights and responsibilities of workers and
their representatives on health and safety-related matters, and the election of safety representatives and
establishment of safety committees (with equal representation between management and labor) to serve
health and safety-related functions. The elected representatives should have a legally recognized role that
goes beyond consultation in activities such as the development of the comprehensive process hazard
analysis, implementation of corrective actions generated from hierarchy of control analyses, management
of change, incident investigation, audits, and the identification, prevention, and control of all process
hazards. The regulation should provide workers and their representatives with the authority to stop work
that is perceived to be unsafe until the employer resolves the matter or the regulator intervenes.
Workforce participation practices should be documented by the refinery to the regulator;
f. Require reporting of information to the public to the greatest extent feasible, such as a summary of the
comprehensive process hazard analysis (PHA) which should include a list of inherently safer systems
implemented; safeguards implemented for remaining hazards; standards utilized to reduce risks to As
Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) or similar; and process safety indicators that demonstrate the
effectiveness of the safeguards and management systems;
g. Implement an approach or system that determines when new or improved industry standards and
practices are needed and initiate programs and other activities, such as an advisory committee or forum, to
prompt the timely development and implementation of such standards and practices; and
h. Ensure that a means of sustained funding is established to support an independent, well-funded, well-
staffed, technically competent regulator.
2012-03-I-CA-R22
Implement a compensation system to ensure the regulator has the ability to attract and retain a sufficient
number of employees with the necessary skills and experience to ensure regulator technical competency
at all levels of process safety regulatory oversight and policy development in California. A market
analysis and benchmarking review should be periodically conducted to ensure the compensation system
remains competitive with California petroleum refineries.

2012-03-I-CA-R23
Work with the regulator, the petroleum refining industry, labor, and other relevant stakeholders in the
state of California to develop and implement a system that collects, tracks, and analyzes process safety
leading and lagging indicators from refineries and contractors to promote continuous safety
improvements. At a minimum, this program shall:
a. Require the use of leading and lagging process safety indicators to actively monitor the
effectiveness of process safety management systems and safeguards for major accident
prevention. Include leading and lagging indicators that are measureable, actionable, and
standardized. Require that the reported data be used for continuous process safety improvement
and accident prevention;
b. Analyze data to identify trends and poor performers and publish annual reports with the data at
facility and corporate levels;
c. Require companies to publicly report required indicators annually at facility and corporate
levels;
d. Use process safety indicators (1) to drive continuous improvement for major accident
prevention by using the data to identify industry and facility safety trends and deficiencies and (2)
to determine appropriate allocation of regulator resources and inspections; and
e. Be periodically updated to incorporate new learning from world-wide industry improvements
in order to drive continuous major accident safety improvements in California.

Appendix C: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Regarding the
Safety Case Regulatory Approach
1. Is it true that the safety case regulatory approach leads to self-regulation by industry?
Critics of the safety case regulatory approach have noted that this type of regulatory regime is likely to
result in mere industry self-regulation.456 Critics have also noted that this is at least partly due to the fact
that there is no will in the US to ensure that regulators have the tools, resources, and competence to
effectively regulate workplaces. The CSB and those with experience in developing and implementing the
safety case regulatory regime have repeatedly stated that the purpose of the safety case regulatory
approach is to ensure that all hazards have been identified, evaluated, and controlled so that risks are
reduced to as low as reasonably practicable, or ALARP. In simple terms, the safety case report is a series
of claims as to how an installation is being safety operated. The real strength of the safety case regulatory
regime is testing the validity of those claims through strategic intervention by competent, well-funded
regulators. Advanced performance-based regulatory regimes in the United Kingdom (UK) and Norway,
for example,457 incorporate a list of regulator-accepted standards and good practices that provide
companies with the minimum performance that is expected. Companies must demonstrate that they meet
or exceed those standards. Therefore, companies are aware of minimum performance expectations they
must meet as they work to reduce risks to ALARP. If a competent regulator is not in place, then the
safety case report equates to nothing more than a lifeless document sitting on a shelf, and the criticism of
self-regulation becomes valid.
It is also important to point out that in a letter from the USW Local 5 to the CSB dated November 22,
2013, it was stated that “[t]he current system is truly a self regulated system, with the industry setting the
rules, changing the rules, and monitoring themselves.” Individuals are noting that the current system in
place has actually led to self-regulation despite the intent of the PSM standard and RMP program to be
performance-based.
Critics have also argued that there is a lack of transparency with the safety case regime. However, under
the existing PSM standard, none of the PSM elements are made public by the company or the regulator,
including the process hazard analyses and management of change documents. To improve transparency,
many safety case regimes collect and report indicator data, and companies are required make safety case
report summaries publicly available. These are high level documents that are published online and
summarize safety assessments, hazardous materials, hazards and control measures, potential major
incidents, emergency response, and safety management systems.
Rather than accepting the inevitability of catastrophic events, we should act to prevent them from

implementation and style and content of the regulations. The UK implements a safety case regime both onshore and
offshore.

petroleum refineries. There has also been increased dialogue in the US in recent years surrounding the
regulation of the oil and gas industry and how to make improvements. As such, the support exists to not
only shift the current activity-based regulatory structure to a more goal-based safety case regulatory
regime, but to also ensure that competent, well-funded regulators are in place to implement and enforce
such a regime.
2. How does the safety case regulatory regime in the US allow for changes to be made without requiring
rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act?
The Administrative Procedure Act, or APA, was passed in 1947, and lays out the basic framework under
which federal rulemaking is conducted. It defines “rule” as “the whole or a part of an agency statement of
general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or
policy or describing the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of an agency…”458
“Rulemaking” is defined as the “agency process for formulating, amending, or repealing a rule.”459
Federal agencies often impact their specific area of jurisdiction by publishing rules promulgated through
notice and comment rulemaking, or informal rulemaking, under the APA. Unfortunately, as this report
discusses at length, the rulemaking process in the US is cumbersome and some federal agencies, such as
OSHA and the EPA, are subject to additional requirements and more stringent review standards that go
above and beyond those contained in the APA. To avoid these additional burdens, many agencies provide
further guidance to regulated parties through more informal means, such as answering questions and
issuing policy statements, guidance, or opinion letters. Another way to lessen the burden on regulating
agencies and their regulated entities is to adopt performance or goal-based regulations rather than
prescriptive regulations. Performance-based standards state the objective or outcome to be achieved, such
as risk reduction, without describing the specific means of obtaining that objective. This provides the
regulated entities with the freedom and flexibility to work to achieve a stated goal, such as reducing risks
to as low as reasonably practicable, or ALARP, through their chosen and preferred means.460
Performance-based standards also provide flexibility to the regulator; for example, in a safety case
regulatory regime, should the regulator determine through assessment of the safety case report and/or
inspection that the facility has not reduced risks to ALARP with regard to a specific hazard, he or she may
require that the facility take additional steps to further reduce risk without needing to propose and adopt a
new rule or regulation to address it. The regulator must accept the safety case report in order for the
facility to operate.
The Regulatory Flexibility Act was passed in 1980 during the Carter Administration. It requires agencies
to prepare and make available for public comment regulatory flexibility analyses of proposed rulemaking,
and also encourages agencies to consider alternatives to rulemaking, including “the use of performance
rather than design standards…”461 Executive Order 13272 then directed federal agencies to establish
procedures and policies to comply with the Act.462 Federal agencies have been encouraged to adopt

112

Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
performance-based standards in the US for decades. Recognizing the inefficient process of federal
rulemaking in the US, President Clinton signed Executive Order 12866 in September of 1993, which,
among other things, directed federal agencies to “identify and assess alternative forms of
regulation…[and] specify performance objectives, rather than specifying the behavior or manner of
compliance that regulated entities must adopt.”463 Executive Order 13563, entitled Improving Regulation
and Regulatory Review, supplemented and reaffirmed Executive Order 12866 by ordering agencies to
“identify and consider regulatory approaches that reduce burdens and maintain flexibility and freedom of
choice for the public.”464 Its stated goal was to “protect public health, welfare, safety, and our
environment while promoting economic growth, innovation, competitiveness, and job creation.”465 Its
seven guiding principles are as follows:
• Increase predictability and reduce uncertainty;
• Use and rely on best available science;
• Ensure public participation and open exchange of ideas;
• Use the most innovative and least burdensome tools;
• Consider cost benefit analysis (quantitative and qualitative);
• Ensure regulations are publicly available, consistent, written in plain language and easy to
understand; and
• Measure results and seek to improve actual results.466
The safety case regime aims to satisfy all of these principles.
California has adopted its own version of the APA, known as the California Administrative Procedure
Act (CAPA) (California Government Code §11340 et seq.).467 Among its many requirements for
California state agencies that adopt regulations, CAPA directs them to consider the substitution of
performance standards for prescriptive standards.468 CAPA defines “performance standard” as “a
regulation that describes an objective with the criteria stated for achieving the objective.”469
Federal agencies that are engaged in and responsible for regulating high hazards, such as NASA and the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), have adopted goal or performance-based standards that require
risks to be reduced to “as safe as reasonably practicable” (ASARP) and “as low as reasonably
achievable,” (ALARA), respectively. The OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard also
contains performance-based elements to some extent; for example, it provides regulated entities with
flexibility in how to perform a process hazard analysis (PHA). However, it contains no risk reduction
goals such as ALARP. This has resulted in an activity-based regulatory scheme that emphasizes
completing activities, such as a PHA or a Management of Change (MOC) analysis, rather than actual risk
reduction. Without a risk reduction goal such as ALARP in place, the PSM standard will not have the

ability to successfully drive continuous improvement and adaptation of industry safety management
advances.
3. Can the safety case regulatory approach work in the US when workforce involvement is emphasized
less than other regions and unionization rates are lower than other countries?
A majority of the workforce in California petroleum refineries is unionized, as the unionization rate for
the 14 petroleum refineries in California is actually 73 percent,470 which is significantly higher than the
2012 rates for the US as a whole (11.1 percent), Australia (17.9 percent), the UK (25.8 percent), and
Norway (54.7 percent).471 Despite a declining unionization rate in the UK, the region has developed
strong onshore and offshore regulations that provide for the creation of protected safety representative
positions and safety committees for unionized and non-unionized facilities. These positions are meant to
create a healthier and safer workplace, and result in better decision-making regarding health and safety,
increased productivity, higher workforce motivation, a stronger commitment to implementing decisions
or actions (as employees have been actively involved in reaching these decisions), and greater
cooperation and trust.472 The HSE has devoted extensive time and resources to ensuring employers are
complying with these regulations and understand the importance and benefits of involving workers in
health and safety-related matters.
The UK also has a standard establishing the minimum level of training that elected safety representatives
offshore should receive to enable them to fully perform their functions as defined in the Safety
Representatives and Safety Committees Regulations – SI 1989/971. This training standard, entitled the
OPITO Approved Standard, was developed by an industry workgroup facilitated by OPITO.473 In June
2013, Det Norske Veritas (DNV)474 became accredited by OPITO to offer newly developed training
courses to more than 2,000 elected safety representatives in the offshore industry. The training, which
has been driven and supported by HSE, Oil and Gas UK, and the Offshore Industry Advisory
Committee’s Workforce Involvement Group, consists of four separate Modules run over the course of
eight days.475 The training covers topics such as Understanding and Identifying Major Accident Hazards
and Investigating Incidents and Applying Root Cause Analysis.
The CSB recognizes the HSE’s effort to improve workforce involvement through regulations, protected
positions, and training, and has recommended in this report that California develop regulations and
guidelines to establish similar protected safety positions to ensure effective workforce participation. The
470 In September 2013, the USW provided the CSB with a list of California petroleum refinery locations as of
October 2012 and the existing unionization representation at those refineries. Of the 15 petroleum refineries
operating in California as of October 2012, 11 of those were unionized, with USW providing the union
representation at all 11 facilities.

CSB believes the HSE model can also be effective in the US as these regulations require effective safety
representation regardless of unionization rates.
4. Has the safety case regulatory approach resulted in fewer major accidents?
The CSB has identified a small number of independent studies conducted on the impact of the safety case
regulatory approach on safety performance onshore and offshore. In 1999, a report commissioned by the
HSE (“the Aberdeen Report”) which evaluated the impact of the offshore Safety Case Regulations on
offshore safety was published.476 One of the purposes of the study was to review published safety data
for trends in offshore accidents and incidents from 1990 until 1997.477 Upon this review, it was
determined there had been a decrease in accidents since the implementation of the offshore safety case
regulations in the UK, but cautioned it was difficult to distinguish the effect of the safety case regulations
from other industry activities such as the level and type of exploration and production activity, oil prices,
and industry-led initiatives.478 The Aberdeen Report also cautioned about the difficulties in analyzing
offshore data that also hold true for the more current data presented in Figure 3. The total number of
accidents and incidents recorded can be affected by industry attitudes toward reporting, changes in how
and what data is reported, and the decrease or increase in offshore activity. As stated in the Aberdeen
Report, “[d]espite these cautions, accident statistics play an important role in the analysis of the state of
safety in any industry, since accidents represent the ‘bottom line’ in safety. It is therefore important to
analyze the trends, but to also take the drawbacks into consideration.”479 As discussed in this report, the
reporting and analyzing leading process safety indicators is important to gain a better understanding of
how safety management systems are functioning, and thus a better idea of how well the various regimes
are managing hazards and mitigating risk.
Statistics from the seven years covered by the Aberdeen Report indicated an overall decrease in reported
accident rates in the UK and Norwegian databases up until 1994. From 1994 to 1997, both the UK and
Norway reported a slight increase in the number of reported accidents.480 Norway did report a drop in
1997 from 1996. The decrease reported up until 1994 for the UK appeared to be independent of the
offshore production activities as those levels had been on the increase during the same time period.
Drilling in the UK decreased during the same time frame, making the cause for the decrease in reported
drilling accidents unclear.
More recent reviews of accident data indicate decreasing trends in accident statistics. The Presidential Oil
Spill Commission noted the following in its report to the President on the Macondo disaster:
[f]rom 2004 to 2009, fatalities in the offshore oil and gas industry were
more than four times higher per person-hours worked in U.S. waters than
in European waters, even though many of the same companies work in
both venues. This striking statistical discrepancy reinforces the view that
the problem is not an inherent trait of the business itself, but rather

depends on the differing cultures and regulatory systems under which
members of the industry operate.481
In September 2013, Det Norske Veritas (DNV)482 released a position paper discussing necessary
improvements to reduce risk of major offshore accidents, and noted in the report that “there are no good
globally accepted metrics for major accident hazards…”483 However, DNV was able to point to UK
HSE’s Hydrocarbon Releases Database System (HCR)484 in the North Sea to provide an example of
improving safety performance trends.485 The HRC contains detailed voluntary information of over 4,000
hydrocarbon releases offshore from close to 300 installations since 1992. The HRC data, plotted in
Figure 3, show the total number of releases to be on the decline. Classifying the severity of a release is
based on agreed-upon criteria with the offshore industry.486 The UK has defined significant events to be
those that, if ignited, have the potential to cause a major accident where multiple casualties could occur.
The occurrence of any hydrocarbon release is undesirable because of the potential to escalate, and so
reporting data from minor incidents has also been included in Figure 3 below.

Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
It is important to note that major accidents are low-probability, high-consequence events, and as such they
are difficult to measure. According to Dr. Andrew Hopkins, major accidents are more difficult to define
than, say, a car accident, and they are rare, making it difficult to estimate the number of major accidents
prevented.488 In addition, based on the data in existence, there is a continued need for improved data
collection; key leading performance indicators development and implementation on a global scale would
provide an improved glimpse into how safety is being managed for major accident prevention.
A team of three independent safety experts was asked to conduct an independent evaluation of the
operational effectiveness of the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority (NOPSA), which was
established in January 2005 to regulate offshore health and safety in Australia (it was superseded by
NOPSEMA in January 2012). The 2008 report released as a result of the evaluation noted that the team
of experts received submissions identifying issues surrounding the safety case regime from twelve
stakeholders, including the Australian Workers Union, the Maritime Union of Australia, and the
International Association of Drilling Contractors. The report states that a majority of the submissions
expressed that the safety case regime had “generally been a success…” and “had led to improvements and
already brought forth better consistency in many areas….”489 The report noted that there was general
stakeholder agreement “that the regulatory processes have been improved.”490
As mentioned in Section 3.2.1.2 of the report, following the Macondo incident in April 2010, an
independent review of the offshore safety case regime in the UK was conducted by a panel consisting of
three independent appointees, including Professor Geoffrey Maitland at Imperial College London. A
report was published discussing the review in December 2011, and it noted that, while not perfect, the
offshore safety case regime was “robust and effective at identifying risks and appropriate measures for
mitigation and response….”491 The report stated the following:
From its analysis of the existing UK framework and the information it
gleaned from its discussion with those directly involved in the sector
from both an operational and regulatory perspective, the Review
Panel was reassured that the UK regime already incorporates a
number of positive, key features which were not present in the US at
the time of the Macondo incident. At a high level, the Panel notes and
commends in particular:

innovation and continuous improvement in process integrity,

• the strength of the mechanisms in place for independent, third party
verification in the crucial areas of well design and integrity of safety
critical equipment,
• the rigour with which the potential environmental impacts of the
industry are examined and of the controls and procedures in place to
mitigate them,
• the detailed and comprehensive emergency response framework
which exists for managing the consequences of incidents should they
occur,
• the high regard in which the UK authorities, in the form of DECC,
HSE and MCA, are held both by UK operators and international
observers,
• the fact that the events in the Gulf of Mexico have clearly acted as a
catalyst for UK operators, working in concert with the regulators and
other stakeholders, to redouble their efforts to improve safety and to
strengthen response capabilities.492
5. The UK HSE has published reports493 showing significant industry problems with maintenance of
safety critical equipment, poor understanding of the potential impact of degrading plant and utility
systems on safety critical elements, and lack of understanding of the role of asset integrity and the concept
of barriers in major hazard risk control. Don’t these reports developed by the UK regulator demonstrate
that the safety case is not effective and is not working?
The CSB recognizes that there have been critiques of the safety case regime and its implementation. The
CSB acknowledges that the safety case is not perfect and that no regulatory system will be perfect in its
implementation. Some have noted the issue of aging equipment due to many issues, including the harsh
conditions that exist in the North Sea. Regulators and commissions in the UK have found degradation of
pipes, valves, and other equipment at many facilities due to company deferrals of maintenance,
insufficient testing of safety-critical elements, and a continuing industry culture of responding to
disasters, rather than anticipating worst-case scenarios. However, the safety case regime’s adaptive
nature has been able to address these concerns. The HSE has recognized asset integrity management and
the issue of ageing equipment as key issues to address in its inspection programs, and has developed
internal processes and priorities for these areas.
In 2010, the UK HSE initiated Key Programme 4 to address the issue of aging equipment offshore and the
operation of installations beyond their design life.494 The same year, the HSE published a report intended

presents the findings of an analysis of loss of containment incidents to indicate the extent to which ageing
plant equipment may be a factor. This type of programmatic proactive approach and information
dissemination is lacking in the US both on and offshore.
6. How have other countries implemented the safety case regime? What challenges do the countries face
when transitioning to a safety case approach?
From the international safety case community, the CSB has found that when transitioning to a safety case
regime there are many obstacles that may hinder the transition, such as:
• Major stakeholders not being committed to the process, unconvinced of the need;
• Lack of understanding that the safety case regime is a “process” to be undertaken by the duty
holder and the workforce to improve understanding of the hazards, risks, and their controls, and
to put in place measures for continuous improvement, rather than just creation of a “document”;
• Lack of sufficient funding by government and industry; and
• Lack of the necessary legislative timetable.
The transition to a safety case regime has significant challenges for both the duty holder and the regulator,
including:
• The safety case report could be treated as a check-the-box exercise;
• Documented safety management system does not reflect reality;
• Poor identification of hazards and risks;
• Poor understanding of the performance of control systems;
• Attempting to justify existing controls rather than to seek opportunity to improve;
• Insufficient workforce involvement in the process;
• The safety case process is under-resourced;
• The safety case report is “inaccessible” so the report simply lives on the shelf;
• The regulator does not use the safety case report to inform the inspection or audit;
• Limited requirement for the reporting of accidents, dangerous occurrences and precursors
resulting in lack of comprehensive performance data; and
• The regulator is under-resourced, technically challenged, poorly trained, has poor systems and
procedures, and is inconsistent.
In implementing the safety case regime, there should be regard for the regulatory principles and
frameworks which represent best practice. The underlying principles are:
• The legislation and regulation should be fit for purpose, not simply superimposed on existing
prescriptive regulation;
495 See http://www.hse.gov.uk/research/rrpdf/rr823-summary-guide.pdf (accessed November, 1, 2013).
119

Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
• Regulation should be effective and efficient; and
• Industry should move away from a culture of compliance with detailed prescriptive regulation to
one of involving the workforce in understanding the hazards.
Some significant points worth noting from international experience in setting up the regulation are:
• Staff should be recruited against detailed job descriptions and should cover the full range of
technical, management and regulatory requirements;
• Pay rates and terms and conditions should be sufficient to attract highly qualified staff;
• A competency framework needs to be developed reflecting the required knowledge, skills, and
experience required to undertake;
• Appropriate training programs must be in place;
• An electronic dedicated safety case assessment procedure which captures the detail of the process
to be followed and records the background to the decision-making process will be needed. This
helps ensure good quality, consistent, and transparent assessment and provides a database of
information which is used for future validation/topic facility inspections. It also provides a
comprehensive record of the process which can be used in the event of an appeal against an
assessment decision;
• An accident and dangerous occurrence data base will be needed to store knowledge and data to
provide reference information and the capacity to analyze trends; and
• An emergency reporting and response process is necessary to ensure all significant events are
properly logged and dealt with.

Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
Appendix D: CSB Staff May 2014 Response to the Board’s Motion
to Postpone issued on January 15, 2014
Background
On January 15, 2014, the CSB held a public meeting in Richmond, California, to present the draft
Chevron Regulatory Report for a vote by the Board. In the first CSB Chevron Report (the Chevron
Interim Report), which was approved by the Board on April 19, 2013, the CSB staff committed to
investigating additional issues which would be presented in a final report on the incident. These issues
included the regulatory oversight of petroleum refineries in California. Due to deployments to West,
Texas, and Geismar, Louisiana, the CSB Chevron investigation team produced a second interim draft
report focused solely on the regulation of petroleum refineries. At the Richmond public meeting, the
Board moved to postpone a vote on the draft regulatory report in order for the CSB investigation staff to
address additional issues raised concerning regulatory oversight of petroleum refineries and the proposed
safety case regime. The CSB staff was given 120 days from the date of the public meeting to respond to
the motion.
I.
1. Does Cal/OSHA have sufficient authority to require timely abatement of hazards associated
with serious and willful violations?
CSB Investigations Staff Response:
Following the August 6th incident at the Chevron Richmond Refinery, Cal/OSHA cited Chevron for,
among other things, failing to replace pipe clamps at the refinery, and ordered Chevron to replace those
pipe clamps by a certain date. The CSB Chevron Interim Report states that Chevron has a history of
frequently using leak repair clamps to externally stop process fluid leaks, and that following discovery of
the leak on the 4-sidecut piping prior to the incident, “Chevron hoped to forestall a shutdown by installing
a leak repair clamp.”496 The CSB determined that Chevron had more than 100 clamps on hydrocarbon
and other piping components containing hazardous flammable process fluids at the Richmond refinery
and that reliance on such clamps to mitigate leaks “identifies serious questions about its mechanical
integrity program.”497 The interim report, which was approved by the Board on April 19, 2013,
committed to evaluating the Chevron Richmond Refinery’s use of clamps and its mechanical integrity
program as they relate to the refinery’s process safety culture in the final CSB report on the Chevron
incident.
A letter written by California Representative George Miller dated January 15, 2014 discussed Chevron’s
use of clamps and expressed concern that some of the clamps have not been replaced, and will not be
replaced until late 2014. The letter stated that under the California Labor Code, an employer is not
obligated to correct a Cal/OSHA safety violation if they appeal. According to Representative Miller,
496 CSB. Chevron Interim Report. April 19, 2013; p 62.
497 Ibid.
121

Chevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014
Chevron appealed its Cal/OSHA citations on February 19, 2013. In the letter Rep. Miller requested that
given these facts, the CSB investigators should assess the issue of timely abatement, and consider making
recommendations to the Legislature and Governor on this matter.
The CSB staff notes that while it has already committed to evaluating the use of clamps at the Chevron
Richmond Refinery as it relates to mechanical integrity and process safety culture, we are not aware of a
causal connection between the refinery’s use of the clamps to mitigate leaks and the August 6th incident.
Regulatory bodies often cite companies for deficiencies following an incident that are not related to that
incident. However, the CSB is directed under the Clean Air Act to “investigate (or cause to be
investigated), determine and report to the public in writing the facts, conditions, and circumstances and
the cause or probable cause” of an accidental release.498 (emphasis added). The CSB’s Board Order
040, Procedure G: Causal Analysis, discusses requirements of formal analysis tools that identify the
multiple causes of an incident, including technical, organizational, and societal causes. Thus, while the
CSB staff committed to analyzing the issue of clamps at the refinery as it pertains to safety culture, the
staff did not analyze the usage of clamps and abatement in its regulatory report, as it was not determined
to be causal and was therefore not within the scope of the regulatory investigation.
2. Should Contra Costa County Health Services have direct enforcement authority under the
Industrial Safety Ordinance?
The CSB staff looked into this matter, including interviewing key personnel, and determined that while
having enforcement power is generally beneficial, a CSB recommendation on the issue is not warranted in
this case, as Contra Costa County’s lack of enforcement authority under the ISO is not causal to the
August 6th incident. According to Contra Costa County officials, the inspectors have never gone to the
District Attorney to enforce the ISO. In addition, these officials have stated to the CSB that the Chevron
Richmond Refinery has cooperated fully with past recommendations and has addressed any violations
issued as a result of any audit conducted by Contra Costa County inspectors. While the CSB agrees that
having enforcement power provides the regulator with another tool to ensure compliance with regulations,
there is no causal connection to the August 6th incident and therefore no additional recommendation
regarding this issue is warranted.
3. Does Contra Costa County Health Services have sufficient resources to conduct
comprehensive inspections and retain technically qualified personnel?
The report discusses the lack of resources and funding within the Contra Costa Hazardous Materials
Program, which has limited its ability to hire additional highly qualified staff to oversee the petroleum
refineries in Contra Costa County. The engineers are part of a bargaining unit and their salaries are paid
through the county’s general fund, which has experienced annual budget reductions in the millions. The
CSB agrees that for a performance based regulatory approach to be effective it is essential to have a well
funded, qualified regulator and has therefore added a recommendation to the City of Richmond and
Contra Costa County.
498 42 U.S.C. §7412 (r)(6)(C)(i) (1990).

4. Does Contra Costa County Health Services have sufficient authority to require facilities to
undertake feasible risk reduction measures, such as best practices, which go beyond minimum
regulatory requirements?
The draft report discusses on page 89 that Contra Costa engineers conduct CalArp and ISO/RISO audits
concurrently at each covered facility generally once every three years. The engineers are only able to
audit against the regulatory requirements, and while they can issue “consider” action items to the facility
recommending actions above and beyond regulatory requirements, they do this very infrequently.
The Chevron Interim Report addressed ISO regulatory deficiencies, including the fact that there is no
required implementation of inherent safety (unlike in the safety case). The Interim Report issues
recommendations R3, R4 and R6 and R7, which request the City of Richmond and Contra Costa County
to revise the ISO to require damage mechanism hazard reviews and the documented use of inherently
safer systems analysis and the hierarchy of controls “to the greatest extent feasible” in establishing
safeguards for identified process hazards. The recommendations note that the goal shall be to drive the
risk of major accidents to As Low As Reasonably Practicable, or ALARP.
The ISO is currently being revised to implement these recommendations, and should be finalized as early
as June 2014. The revised regulatory language would require facilities to reduce risk to “the greatest
extent feasible,” which is a concept that is very similar to ALARP. Contra Costa County will have the
ability to issue guidance that elaborates on what will be required to achieve that standard.
The CSB staff believes that these recommendations cover the issue raised in this question, and no
additional recommendations are warranted.
II.
In the motion to postpone the Board made the following proposal to have additional questions addressed
by an expert panel:
The CSB staff shall convene a multidisciplinary expert panel (selected by the full Board), similar to
the Baker Panel established after the BP Texas City incident, to provide the agency with an
assessment of the following topics regarding regulating process safety in refineries in California:
1. To address questions raised in the comments received by the CSB, the panel shall assess the
available process safety performance data to evaluate the effectiveness of the safety case regulatory
model for refineries.
2. Assess the challenges of making safety case operational and effective with regard to the following
topics:
a. What is the role of transparency and community involvement under this regime? Are
safety case reports made public?

b. How are workers empowered as part of the tripartite model? Have there been
retaliatory actions taken against workers for their involvement, and what protective
measures are in place?
c. Are safety committees mandatory or optional in non-union workplaces? How are safety
committee members selected, and under what authority?
d. Is there a public data base of incident and near miss reporting? How are process safety
performance indicators developed and used? Are these made public?
e. How are standards for minimum levels of risk set (ALARP presumably goes beyond
minimum levels)?
f. What are the enforcement methods used by regulators under the safety case?
g. What are the key transition issues that were addressed with facilities in operation at the
time the safety case was adopted?
In response to this Board motion the staff has developed a white paper with staff responses to the
questions posed by the Board. Additionally, the CSB is planning a public hearing in the Spring of 2015
to discuss various models, including safety case, for regulating high hazard facility safety.
