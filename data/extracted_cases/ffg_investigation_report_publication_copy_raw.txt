Investigation Report
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
On Thursday, January 28, 2021, between approximately 8:45 and 10:15 a.m., liquid nitrogen overflowed from
an immersion freezer located inside the Plant 4 building at the Foundation Food Group (FFG) facility in
Gainesville, Georgia. The release began while maintenance workers were troubleshooting operational issues
with the freezer, which was designed and owned by Messer LLC (Messer) and leased to FFG. Once released,
the liquid nitrogen quickly vaporized, expanded, and accumulated inside a partially enclosed lower-level room
that lacked mechanical ventilation. The two maintenance workers who were troubleshooting the freezer at the
time of the release were fatally injured by asphyxiation due to the vaporized liquid nitrogen.
The uncontrolled liquid nitrogen release continued, and the two deceased maintenance workers went undetected
for 30 to 60 minutes, until another worker went looking for them and saw a four- to five-foot-high vapor cloud
filling the room. This worker reported the incident to management, which then initiated an evacuation. During
the ensuing building-wide evacuation, at least 14 other FFG employees, including members of management,
responded to the incident by either investigating the freezer room or attempting to rescue their coworkers. As a
result, four additional FFG employees were fatally injured by asphyxiation, and three other FFG employees and
a firefighter were seriously injured presenting asphyxiation symptoms.
Court filings show that after the incident FFG sued its insurance company for damages of roughly $1.7 million.
Messer reported business and property losses of roughly $245,000.
SAFETY ISSUES
The CSB’s investigation identified the safety issues below.
• Single Point of Failure. The immersion freezer design included a device called a bubbler tube, which
was used to measure the liquid nitrogen level inside the freezer. The bubbler tube was likely bent during
maintenance activity, rendering it unable to measure and control the freezer’s liquid nitrogen level. As a
result, liquid nitrogen overflowed from the freezer and filled the room with vaporized nitrogen. This
design was vulnerable to a single point of failure. Once the tube became bent, there was nothing else to
prevent the release of liquid nitrogen. The design team did not adequately consider the consequences of
the failure of the bubbler tube—a critical safety component—and did not identify appropriate
safeguards to mitigate its potential failure. In addition, during fabrication of the immersion freezer,
Messer failed to detect a manufacturing defect that exacerbated the potential for the bubbler tube to be
bent—a missing clamp meant to secure the bubbler tube to the freezer. (Section 4.1)
• Atmospheric Monitoring and Alarm Systems. There is abundant industry guidance on the importance
of atmospheric monitoring when the potential for hazardous atmospheres exists. FFG, however, did not
install atmospheric monitoring equipment in the freezer room. As such, there was no equipment
installed to detect the oxygen-deficient atmosphere in the freezer room, automatically shut off the liquid
nitrogen supply, and notify personnel to evacuate the area. (Section 4.2)
• Emergency Preparedness. FFG did not inform, train, equip, drill, or otherwise prepare its workforce
for a release of liquid nitrogen. FFG’s workforce lacked knowledge of the hazards of nitrogen and its
ability to create an oxygen-deficient atmosphere, were unable to recognize an oxygen-deficient
7

Investigation Report
atmosphere, and lacked any equipment or PPE that would have enabled safe entry into an oxygen-
deficient atmosphere. As a result, after the discovery of the first two deceased workers, four other
employees who entered the freezer room also died from asphyxiation due to the released nitrogen during
response or rescue attempts. Three other employees responded and were seriously injured. At least
seven other employees responded and were not seriously injured, but they were at risk of nitrogen
asphyxiation due to their proximity to the release. FFG also did not proactively interact with local
emergency responders prior to the incident, despite relying upon them to respond to emergencies at its
facility. (Section 4.3)
• Process Safety Management System. FFG had no documented process safety management policy,
allowed the job position responsible for safety management to be vacant for more than a year prior to
the incident, did not evaluate the process hazards associated with the freezer, lacked written procedures
and a management of change process, and did not train its workers on the asphyxiation hazards of liquid
nitrogen. Despite robust industry guidance on process safety management systems, FFG was not
required by law to implement it. As a result of the lack of specific regulations for cryogenic asphyxiants,
FFG did not implement systems and practices that could have reduced the incident’s severity or
prevented the accidental release altogether. (Section 4.4)
• Product Stewardship. Messer owned the liquid nitrogen bulk storage tanks and the Line 4 immersion-
spiral freezer and leased the equipment to FFG. At the time of the incident, Messer had institutional
knowledge, experience, policies, and practices for effective product stewardship but applied those
practices only to the bulk storage tanks and not to the Line 4 freezer process. Throughout its relationship
with FFG, Messer had identified issues with FFG’s safety practices and nonconformance to industry
guidance, but despite FFG’s unsafe practices, Messer continued to supply FFG with liquid nitrogen.
Had Messer suspended service until FFG corrected known safety deficiencies, this incident may have
been prevented. (Section 4.5)
CAUSE
The CSB determined the cause of the liquid nitrogen release was the failure of the immersion freezer’s liquid
level control system to accurately measure and control the liquid nitrogen level inside the freezer, which resulted
from deformation of the system’s bubbler tube component.
Contributing to the incident were 1) Messer’s design of the freezer, which allowed the failure of a single level
measurement device to result in an uncontrolled loss of containment of liquid nitrogen, 2) FFG’s lack of any
process safety management systems or practices that could have prevented the incident, 3) a lack of regulatory
coverage for liquid nitrogen, which enabled FFG to elect not to implement process safety practices that could
have prevented the incident, and 4) Messer’s inadequate product stewardship practices, which resulted in Messer
continuing to supply FFG with liquid nitrogen despite FFG’s unsafe practices.
Contributing to the severity of the incident were 1) FFG’s inadequate emergency preparedness, which resulted
in at least 14 employees responding to the release by entering the freezer room or the surrounding area to
investigate the incident or to attempt to rescue their coworkers, and 2) the absence of atmospheric monitoring
and alarm devices that could have alerted workers to the presence of a hazardous atmosphere and warned them
against entering it.

Investigation Report
RECOMMENDATIONS
To Gold Creek Foods (current owner of the FFG facility)a
2021-03-I-GA-R1
Include in the emergency action program provisions for proactively interacting with and informing local
emergency response resources of all emergencies at the former FFG Plant 4 facility to which Gold Creek
expects them to respond. At a minimum, Gold Creek should:
a) inform local emergency responders of the existence, nature, and location of hazardous substances at its
facilities, including liquid nitrogen;
b) inform local emergency responders of the location of emergency-critical equipment such as bulk storage
tanks, points of use, isolation valves, E-stop switches, and any other emergency equipment or systems
with which emergency responders may need to interact; and,
c) provide local emergency responders with information, such as facility plot plans, engineering drawings,
or other information needed to mount an effective emergency response.
To Messer LLCb
2021-03-I-GA-R2
Update the company product stewardship policy to:
a) include participation by Messer in customers’ process hazard analyses (PHAs). The policy should
require that these PHAs be conducted in a manner which conforms with CCPS Guidelines for Hazard
Evaluation Procedures prior to the startup of a cryogenic freezing process;
b) require verification that proper signage, in accordance with CGA P-76 Hazards of Oxygen-Deficient
Atmospheres, is displayed on and/or near equipment; and,
c) require a facility and/or equipment siting review to ensure that emergency shutoff devices, including E-
stops, are located such that they can be safely actuated during a release of liquid nitrogen.
a
Gold Creek has developed emergency response procedures that could have reduced the severity of this incident. Consequently, the CSB
makes no recommendations to Gold Creek pertaining to the development of emergency preparedness policies or employee training for
its emergency action program. Additionally, as of this report’s publication, there are no liquid nitrogen freezing processes at the former
FFG Plant 4 building which Gold Creek now operates. Consequently the CSB makes no recommendation to Gold Creek related to
ventilation or process safety management practices for liquid nitrogen processes.
b
After the incident Messer revised its freezer design to include multiple layers of protection against liquid nitrogen overflow. Messer
also revised its Quality Control process and procedures to require verification of the presence of the necessary bubbler tube clamps and
reordered the sequence of inspection steps to facilitate this verification. Consequently the CSB makes no recommendation to Messer
regarding the design of its immersion freezers or its Quality Control process.

Investigation Report
1 BACKGROUND
1.1 COMPANIES INVOLVED
1.1.1 FOUNDATION FOOD GROUP
Foundation Food Group (FFG) was a poultry processor located in Gainesville, Georgia, formed by a merger of
Prime-Pak Foods, Inc. (Prime-Pak)a and Victory Processing, Inc. (Victory Processing)b in September 2020.
Prior to the merger, the two companies had been partners in a joint-venture since 2018; Prime-Pak operated in
what became known as the FFG Plant 4 building, discussed further in Section 1.2 below, across the street from
Victory Processing.
At the time of the incident, approximately 135 employees worked in the FFG Plant 4 building. The majority of
the FFG workforce did not speak English as their primary language or were non-English speaking.
Following the incident, in October 2021, Gold Creek Foods (Gold Creek) acquired FFG.
1.1.2 MESSER LLC
Messer LLC (Messer) was formed in March 2019, when Messer Group and CVC Capital Partners Fund VII
(CVC) acquired most of the North American gases business of Linde plc (Linde) [1].c Messer, which is
headquartered in Bridgewater, New Jersey, is an industrial and specialty gases technology and applications
supplier for the industrial, food, medical, chemical, and electronics industries [2]. Messer supplied bulk liquid
nitrogen for FFG and designedd and owned the liquid nitrogen immersion-spiral freezer system, which was
leased to and operated by FFG to freeze poultry products.
1.2 LIQUID NITROGEN FREEZING AT FFG
Following the merger between Prime-Pak and Victory Processing, FFG owned four poultry processing plants in
Gainesville, Georgia. The former Prime-Pak building became FFG Plant 4, which housed five production lines,
denoted as Lines 1 through 5.
Prior to 2020, Prime-Pak and FFG utilized ammonia freezer systems in Plant 4 to freeze poultry products. In
early 2020, FFG began introducing Messer’s liquid nitrogen freezer systems into Plant 4 to increase production
capacity.e FFG and Messer worked collaboratively for several months to prepare for the addition of the liquid
a
Prime-Pak was formed as Milton’s Portion-Pak Meats, Inc. in 1973.
b
Victory Processing was formed in 2006.
c
Linde was required to divest this business as part of its 2018 merger with Praxair, Inc. [49].
d
The immersion-spiral freezer was designed by Linde prior to the Messer acquisition, at which point Messer acquired Linde’s North
American freezer assets.
e
By transitioning from the ammonia spiral freezer to the liquid nitrogen immersion-spiral freezer process, FFG estimated that it would
obtain a 7% increase in the yield of its diced product and eliminate operational issues experienced with the ammonia freezer.

Investigation Report
nitrogen freezer systems. Messer and FFGa entered into a product supply agreement for the lease of two 13,000-
gallon bulk liquid nitrogen tanks, routine liquid nitrogen supply, and a nitrogen spiral freezer. The storage tanks
were installed outside the FFG facility, and the spiral freezer was installed on Line 2 in Plant 4 in May 2020.
The Line 2 process was commissioned into service later that month.
In July 2020, the agreement was amended to include the lease of one additional 13,000-gallon bulk liquid
nitrogen tank and a liquid nitrogen immersion-spiral freezer to be used on Line 4. Installation of the additional
storage tank and immersion-spiral freezer began on December 5, 2020.,
On December 13, 2020, FFG added walls to the Line 4 freezer room where the freezer was installed to separate
the immersion-spiral freezer from the adjacent areas of the plant. Additionally, FFG constructed a “clean room”
opposite of the equipment (Figure 1).b Shortly thereafter, on December 16, 2020, the immersion-spiral freezer
installation was completed, and production on Line 4 commenced the following day, approximately five weeks
prior to the fatal incident.
1.3 LINE 4 FREEZING PROCESS
The FFG Plant 4 building (Figure 1) consisted of five production lines that made various cooked, partially
cooked, and marinated chicken products [3]. Conveyor belts transferred chicken through production equipment,
such as ovens, fryers, freezers, and baggers, on each production line. Line 4, where the release occurred,
processed cooked chicken products.
The Plant 4 building was separated into two processing areas: the “raw” area and the “Ready-To-Eat” (RTE)
area.c The Line 4 process began in the raw area with marination and cooking, then continued to the RTE area,
which contained a dicer, freezer, and packaging equipment. Workers measured product temperatures at various
stages throughout the line to ensure that the product met food safety specifications. Production stopped at the
end of each workday and re-started the following morning.
a
At the time that the product supply agreement was made, FFG had yet to be formed, so Prime-Pak Foods is listed on the agreement.
b
This was a separate project from the Line 4 freezer project. The clean room, also known as the smock changing area, would allow
workers to cross between the raw and RTE areas (Section 1.3) without having to walk around the building. The new clean room was not
yet commissioned at the time of the incident.
c
RTE is defined by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as food for which it is reasonably foreseeable will be eaten without
further processing that would significantly minimize biological hazards [48]. The plant is separated into the two processing areas to
minimize or prevent the contamination of RTE foods with disease-causing bacteria, such as Listeria [53].

Investigation Report
The Messer Line 4 liquid nitrogen immersion-spiral freezera process (Figure 2) occurred in two stages. In the
first stage, a conveyor belt carried the fully cooked diced chicken into an immersion freezer where it was
partially frozen in a -320°F (-196°C) liquid nitrogen bath. The chicken then moved through a transition box to
the second stage, where a conveyor belt carried the partially frozen diced chicken through the spiral freezer as
internal fans circulated vaporized liquid nitrogen within the freezer to complete the freezing process. The frozen
chicken exited the spiral freezer and was packaged and shipped to customers.

annotations by CSB)
Exhaust systems connected to both the immersion and spiral freezers directed the nitrogen gas from inside the
freezers to outside the building through discharge ducting on the roof.
Control valves regulated the flow of liquid nitrogen from storage tanks outside the building through piping along
the roof and into each freezer. FFG workers used a computer control system with touch screens, called a Human
Machine Interface (HMI), to set operating parameters for the freezer system, such as the liquid nitrogen level
inside the immersion freezer, conveyor belt speeds, and exhaust fan speeds. The computer control system
programming included safety interlocks to automatically prevent inadvertent, hazardous liquid nitrogen releases,
which could be activated either by the control system measuring a high liquid level or by pushing emergency
stop (E-stop) buttons located on the freezer exterior. The control system measured the liquid level in the
immersion freezer using a device called the bubbler tube, which is discussed in further detail in Section 3.
To enable access to the inside of the immersion freezer, the freezer was also equipped with a lid that could be
raised, and the transition box had a door that could be opened. The lid and the door were equipped with
permissive proximity switches, or safety switches; as designed, when the lid and door were closed, the safety
switches would enable the freezer to operate normally. If the safety switches lost proximity (meaning that the
door was open and/or the lid was raised), the freezer system was designed to shut off liquid nitrogen supply to
the freezers and to increase the speed of the nitrogen exhaust fans.

The immersion-spiral freezer consisted of two discrete freezers—an immersion freezer and a spiral freezer—connected in series.

1.4 LINE 4 FREEZER ROOM
Figure 3 below illustrates the layout of the FFG Line 4 freezer room.
Figure 3. Diagram of the FFG Line 4 freezer room. (Credit: CSB)
In total, the room had four openings. On the southeast wall, there was an elevated opening through which
conveyor belts brought product from the oven room into the freezer room. Also on the southeast wall was a
large open doorway into the packaging area. Both of these openings on the southeast wall were elevated roughly
five feet from the floor of the freezer room. On the southwest wall, there was a large open doorway leading to
the warehouse and loading dock area. This doorway contained heavy plastic curtains separating the freezer room
from the warehouse and loading dock. On the northwest wall, there was a single door that separated the freezer
room from the clean room. There were no openings in the northeast wall.
The rooms adjacent to the Line 4 freezer room on the northeast and southeast sides were elevated roughly five
feet above the floor level in the freezer room (Figure 4). The adjacent rooms on the southwest and northwest
sides were at the same floor elevation as the freezer room. Thus, the room was recessed below adjacent rooms

Air circulated through the room through the four openings described above. The room had no mechanical
ventilation or heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), although the immersion-spiral freezers
contained exhaust systems designed to remove the vaporized nitrogen from the normal operation of the freezers
(described previously in Section 1.3 and Figure 2).
1.5 DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES BETWEEN FFG AND MESSER
As part of FFG’s and Messer’s supply agreement, Messer retained ownershipa of the bulk liquid nitrogen tanks,
the Line 2 spiral freezer, and the Line 4 immersion-spiral freezer equipment. Messer also supplied FFG with
liquid nitrogen and maintained and inspected the bulk tanks. FFG was responsible for maintaining the
equipment site; ensuring the site complied with safety and environmental regulations; providing necessary

utilities, piping, and connections for use of the equipment; providing adequate security; and maintaining freezer
equipment per Messer instructions.

1.6 LIQUID NITROGEN
1.6.1 PROPERTIES
Nitrogen is a colorless, odorless, non-flammable, non-toxic, inert gas that is abundant in air.a Under specific
temperature and pressure conditions,b Nitrogen is a cryogenic liquid, which is also colorless, odorless, non-
flammable, and non-toxic.
Liquid nitrogen boils at -320 °F (-196 °C) at atmospheric pressure. It produces large volumes of nitrogen gas
when it vaporizes [4]. Nitrogen gas readily mixes with air at room temperature; however, cold nitrogen gas is

Nitrogen makes up about 78% of the earth’s atmosphere [52].

A cryogenic liquid is a refrigerated liquefied gas with a boiling point less than -130°F (-90°C) at atmospheric pressure [5, p. 2].

denser than air and can settle and collect in low areas [4]. Contact with liquid nitrogen or cold nitrogen gas can
cause severe cold burns, frostbite, and hypothermia.a Prolonged breathing of extremely cold gas may damage
lung tissue.
1.6.2 ASPHYXIATION
Liquid nitrogen has a liquid-to-gas expansion ratio of 1 to 696 at 70°F (21°C), meaning that nitrogen gas will
expand to fill the volume of a space 696 times greater than its volume when in the liquid phase [5, p. 5]. High
concentrations of nitrogen gas in an enclosed area will displace oxygen, creating an oxygen-deficient
atmosphere. Atmospheres containing less than 19.5% oxygen are considered oxygen-deficient and can cause a
range of effects on the human body, as shown in Figure 6. Atmospheres containing very low oxygen
concentrations can lead to asphyxiation, an effect in which the body receives inadequate oxygen, resulting in
loss of consciousness or death [6].b At these very low oxygen concentrations (i.e., less than 10%), exposure may
result in the rapid loss of consciousness without warning [7], which can occur in as few as one or two breaths [6,
p. 4].

1.7 LIQUID NITROGEN IN FOOD PROCESSING
Cryogenic freezers using inert gases, such as liquid nitrogen, have become common in the food processing
industry due to their relatively low capital investment, smaller size, and faster freezing time compared with

move, convulsive movements, collapse, abnormal pulse, rapid fatigue, faulty judgment, insensitivity to pain, and abnormal emotions.

Investigation Report
ammonia-based mechanical freezers [9]. In addition to Messer, several companies manufacture cryogenic
freezers for the food processing industry comparable to the one discussed in this report.
Cryogenic immersion-spiral freezers are used in various food freezing applications, including the freezing of
poultry, beef, diced luncheon meats, pizza toppings, marinated meats and vegetables, shrimp, and seafood fillets
[10].
Within the United States, at least 220 poultry processing facilities handle cryogenic liquids. In June 2021, the
U.S. Poultry & Egg Association polled poultry processing facilities and found that 74% of the respondents use
cryogenic freezers, with 22% using liquid nitrogen, 33% using carbon dioxide, and 19% using both liquid
nitrogen and carbon dioxide, as shown in Figure 7.

1.8 REGULATORY COVERAGE
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) do not define liquid nitrogen as a highly hazardous chemical or extremely hazardous substance.
Consequently, OSHA’s Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA’s Risk
Management Program (RMP) rule (40 CFR 68) did not apply to FFG’s liquid nitrogen process [11, 12].
Although FFG also utilized anhydrous ammonia (which is regulated by PSM and RMP) in processes separate
from the Line 4 liquid nitrogen process, FFG asserted that its ammonia processes were also not covered under
21

Investigation Report
the regulations because FFG’s ammonia processes were not interconnected and each utilized a quantity of
anhydrous ammonia less than the quantity required to trigger regulatory coverage. Various other regulations
applied to FFG, and they are discussed in the relevant portions of the report below.

2 INCIDENT DESCRIPTION
2.1 OPERATIONAL ISSUES
After the Line 4 immersion-spiral freezer was commissioned in December 2020, FFG experienced a series of
operational problems with the equipment. Messer returned to the FFG facility on multiple occasions to
troubleshoot these operational issues, including problems with belt loading, liquid nitrogen level control, and
freezing.,
With regard to the belt loading issues, diced chicken product was shifting unevenly to one side of the conveyor
belt as it traveled through the immersion freezer to the spiral freezer. Messer thought that the flow of liquid
nitrogen into the immersion freezer tub was potentially pushing the chicken product to the opposite side of the
conveyor belt, causing the uneven belt loading. Accordingly, on January 23, 2021, Messer modified the design
of the end of the liquid nitrogen inlet piping into the immersion freezer to slow the velocity of liquid nitrogen
entering the immersion tub.b At the time of the incident, Messer and FFG had resolved most, but not all, uneven
belt loading issues in the freezer system.
FFG also reported to Messer that it believed that the liquid nitrogen level indicated on the control panel was
lower than the expected level given the specified level setpoint. In an attempt to address the perceived level
control discrepancy, on January 23, 2021, Messer replaced the liquid nitrogen control valve and transducer on
the immersion freezer. At the time of the incident, Messer believed the liquid nitrogen level control issues had
been resolved, but Messer and FFG were continuing to make other adjustments to the system.,c,

23

Investigation Report
Also, beginning two days prior to the incident, FFG experienced issues when the immersion-spiral freezer was
not fully freezing the diced chicken product. FFG employees stopped Line 4 production operations multiple
times to troubleshoot the problem. On January 26, 2021, Messer was on-site to witness FFG’s attempt to process
the diced product. Based on observations that day, the liquid nitrogen level in the immersion freezer was
lowered to avoid uneven belt loading, which Messer suspected was causing the freezing issues.
The next day, on January 27, 2021, FFG continued to experience freezing issues. FFG increased the liquid level
in the immersion freezer in an attempt to resolve the problem, but this action did not resolve the issue.
Subsequently, an FFG maintenance worker reported to management that he believed the liquid nitrogen level
was too low. As a result, the manager called Messer for guidance. Messer recommended that FFG further
increase the nitrogen level in the freezer and provided FFG with the username and password required to modify
this parameter in the system. Production on the immersion-spiral freezer resumed that afternoon and continued
through the end of the workday.
2.2 DAY OF INCIDENT
2.2.1 LIQUID NITROGEN RELEASE
On January 28, 2021, operations on Line 4 commenced at approximately 7:16 a.m. Continuing the trend from
the previous days, soft, partially-frozen chicken product was observed coming out of the immersion-spiral
freezer., As a result, Line 4 stopped processing chicken at approximately 8:14 a.m. so that maintenance
personnel could troubleshoot the issue. At approximately 8:20 a.m., the Line 4 Packaging Supervisora instructed
the Line 4 workers to go on break while maintenance workers attempted to resolve the freezing issue. The
maintenance workers conducted the maintenance without shutting down the freezer and with the transition box
door and immersion freezer lid safety switches intentionally bypassed.
The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) determined that, likely while the Line 4
workers were on break, the bubbler tube in the immersion freezer somehow became bent, thereby preventing the
freezer’s liquid nitrogen level control system from working properly (described further in Section 3). The liquid
nitrogen level then increased in an uncontrolled manner, and liquid nitrogen overflowed from the immersion
freezer, filling the freezer room with vaporized nitrogen that displaced the room’s oxygen.
After about 20 minutes, at approximately 8:40 a.m., the Line 4 workers returned from break. At this time the
workers noticed a cloud of white fog coming from the Line 4 freezer room but took no further action. According
to one employee, because workers regularly observed white fog in the freezer room, they did not believe there
was a problem. By 9:40 a.m., having not heard from the Line 4 Packaging Supervisor for over an hour, one of
the Line 4 workers decided to look for him. The Line 4 worker entered the Line 4 freezer room through an
elevated opening,b pictured in Figure 3 and Figure 9.
a
The Line 4 Packaging Supervisor was later found fatally injured.
b
Chicken enters the freezer room via conveyor belt through this opening. The bottom edge of this opening is elevated approximately 4
feet and 9 inches above the freezer room floor. This opening was not intended for human use as a passageway and was intended only to
allow for the conveyor belts to enter the freezer room, and to allow for some make-up ventilation. The Line 4 worker crouched down
and crawled through the opening.
24

Investigation Report

County Fire Services, annotations by CSB)
The Line 4 worker observed a dense white cloud approximately four feet high filling the room.a She also saw
one of the maintenance workers lying motionless on the ground in front of the conveyor belt. The Line 4 worker
exited the freezer room by crawling back through the elevated opening and returned to where the other Line 4
workers were congregated in the RTE area. She informed the other workers of what she saw and then crawled
through the elevated opening again, this time with another worker to confirm her observations. The Line 4
workers again returned to the area where the other workers were congregated and then left to locate the Line 1
Packaging Supervisor to inform him about what they had observed.
2.2.2 INCIDENT RESPONSE
Because FFG did not have a surveillance system, the only evidence available to the CSB to use to reconstruct
response activities were the firsthand accounts of the employees who were not fatally injured during the

Investigation Report
incident. The CSB was not able to fully account for the actions of the six fatally injured employees and was also
not able to fully establish the chronological order of the events employees described.
At approximately 9:55 a.m., upon hearing what the Line 4 workers saw in the freezer room, the Line 1
Packaging Supervisor escorted the Line 1 and Line 4 workers from the building.a The Line 1 Packaging
Supervisor was subsequently seen re-entering the building.b Around the same time, other line supervisors began
evacuating the rest of the Plant 4 employees from the building and notified management about the emergency.
Approximately 130 workers were evacuated from the building.
During the evacuation, at least 14 FFG employees responded to the Line 4 freezer area to try to determine what
happened or attempt rescue efforts. Of the employees that responded to the area, four were fatally injured, three
were seriously injured, and at least seven sustained minor injuries or were uninjured.
After hearing about an issue in the Line 4 freezer room, the Production Logistics Manager proceeded to the area
and discovered the Line 4 Packaging Supervisor unconscious in the shipping area adjacent to the Line 4 freezer
room. The Production Logistics Manager attempted to move the Line 4 Packaging Supervisor to the loading
dock but became affected by the nitrogen vapors and retreated to the clean room, which was adjacent to the Line
4 freezer room. The Production Logistics Manager leaned against the clean room wall and became unconscious
from his exposure to nitrogen.
Around the same time, the Maintenance Manager arrived at the clean room area to assess the situation. He
observed a Line 4 production worker lying unconscious on the floor. He bent down and attempted to remove her
from the area but was also affected by the liquid nitrogen vapors. He reported stumbling and nearly fainting
before retreating to exit the building. Realizing that there was a liquid nitrogen release, the Maintenance
Manager and two other FFG employees proceeded to the liquid nitrogen storage tanks located at the front of the
building to manually shut off the liquid nitrogen supply.
At 10:11 a.m., the Director of Prepared Foods Operations called 911 to report the incident.c During the 911 call,
another FFG employee activated the Plant 4 fire alarm near the front of the building. After making the initial
911 call, the Director of Prepared Foods Operations proceeded to the Line 4 freezer room and called the
Environmental Health and Safety (EHS)/Wastewater Manager and Senior Vice President of Operations to
inform them of the situation. These three managers met and proceeded to the clean room adjacent to the Line 4
freezer room where they discovered the Production Logistics Manager leaning against the wall, unconscious, as
well as two other FFG employees (the Line 1 Packaging Supervisor and the Line 4 production worker whom the
Maintenance Manager attempted to rescue) lying unconscious on the floor. In response, the three managers
pulled the Production Logistics Managerd from the clean room to the loading dock at the back of the building.
Firefighters from Hall County Fire Rescue arrived on the scene at around 10:18 a.m., at which time other FFG
employees had already moved the Line 4 Packaging Supervisor out of the affected area. Wearing self-contained
breathing apparatus (SCBA), the emergency responders entered the Line 4 freezer room and encountered a four-

than -100°F (-73°C). Emergency responders pulled the two maintenance workers and the Plant 4
Superintendenta from the Line 4 freezer room and subsequently removed the Line 1 Packaging Supervisor and
the Line 4 production workerb from the clean room. At 10:36 a.m., one of the firefighters activated two of the
immersion-spiral freezer’s E-stop buttons.
2.3 INCIDENT CONSEQUENCES
Five FFG employees died at the FFG facility.c Another died later, after being taken to the hospital. Following
evacuation from the facility, several additional FFG employees experienced symptoms consistent with
asphyxiation, including dizziness, headaches, nausea, and fainting. Many of the employees experiencing these
symptoms were treated by paramedics onsite; however, seven FFG employees were transported by ambulance
and three were transported privately into the local hospital for evaluation and treatment. Of the 10 employees
that went to the hospital, six were treated in the emergency room and released later the same day, three were
admitted, and one was pronounced dead in the emergency room.
Additionally, four of the five emergency responders who entered the building wearing SCBA were also
transported to the hospital after experiencing dizziness, shortness of breath, and abdominal pain. Three of the
emergency responders were treated in the emergency room and released the same day; the fourth was released
the following day.
Ultimately, the liquid nitrogen release in the FFG Line 4 freezer room fatally injured six FFG employees (the
two maintenance workers, the Lines 1 and 4 Packaging Supervisors, the Plant 4 Superintendent, and a Line 4
worker). Autopsy results revealed that all six employees asphyxiated. The incident also resulted in the serious
injury of three FFG employees and one firefighter.
Court filings show that after the incident FFG sued its insurance company for damages of roughly $1.7 million.
Messer reported business and property losses of roughly $245,000.

Investigation Report
3 TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
After the incident, the CSB examined the immersion freezer. Part of the examination involved raising the freezer
lid and conducting a visual examination inside the freezer. The CSB found the bubbler tube bent, as shown in
Figure 10.
Figure 10. Immersion freezer bubbler tube, as found during the post-incident examination of the freezer. As
designed, the tube should be pointing straight downward. (Credit: CSB)
As discussed previously, the immersion freezer was designed to submerge product in a bath of liquid nitrogen,
maintaining a user-specified liquid height in the bath. Messer’s predecessor, Linde, designed the immersion
freezer with a liquid level measurement device called a bubbler tube.a As shown in Figure 11, a bubbler tube
works by maintaining a constant flow rate of vapor through the tube and into the liquid and measuring the
differential pressure between the liquid and atmospheric pressure [11, p. 113]. The immersion freezer control
system then used that differential pressure measurement to calculate the liquid level in the bath and would
change the position of the liquid nitrogen flow control valve to maintain the liquid level at the user-specified
setpoint. Messer also equipped the freezer with a high-level safety interlock that when activated was designed to
a
Also referred to as a “dip tube” [11, p. 113].

Investigation Report
close valves to shut off the flow of additional liquid nitrogen into the freezer, shown below in Figure 12. The
level control loop and the high-level safety interlock both used the bubbler tube as the input sensor.

The CSB tested the functionality of the immersion freezer level control system after the incident. The test
involved filling the immersion tub with water, with the intent of determining 1) whether liquid would overflow
from the freezer, 2) the location from which the liquid would overflow, and 3) the position of the tip of the bent
bubbler tube relative to the overflow liquid level in the tub.
During the test, the CSB documented the following conditions, pictured below in Figure 13 and illustrated in
Figure 14:
29

Investigation Report
• Water overflowed from the inlet side of the freezer.
• The overflow liquid level was lower than the elevation of the tip of the bent bubbler tube.
• The freezer level control system measured no liquid level during the test, and the system called for the
maximum flow of liquid for the duration of the test.
Figure 13. Water overflowing from the immersion freezer tub during post-incident overflow test. (Credit: CSB)
During the incident, because the tip of the tube was bent above the overflow level, the level control system
would have incorrectly measured no liquid level and would have continued calling for additional liquid nitrogen
even though the immersion tub overflowed. Also, because the level measurement would have been artificially
low, the high-level interlock would not have functioned correctly (as illustrated in Figure 14). The CSB
examined the freezer alarm and event log and confirmed that no high-level event was recorded by the freezer
control system during the incident. The CSB concludes that liquid nitrogen overflowed from the immersion
freezer. The liquid nitrogen overflow was caused by the failure of the freezer’s level control and high-level
safety interlock systems.
30

Investigation Report
Figure 14. Simplified conceptual diagram showing the failure state of the immersion freezer level control
system. Not drawn to scale. (Credit: CSB)
The CSB conducted a second overflow test using an as-designed exemplar bubbler tube in place of the bent
incident tube. Both the level control and high-level interlock systems operated as designed (as shown in Figure
12), indicating that during the incident there was likely nothing preventing the correct function of any of the
level control or interlock equipment other than the bent bubbler tube. The CSB concludes that the failure of the
freezer’s level control and high-level safety interlock systems was caused by the deformation of the bubbler
tube.
The immersion freezer level control system operated as designed (and the freezer did not overflow) in the days
leading up to the incident including up until 8:14 a.m. on the morning of the incident when production was
stopped and the freezer was turned over to maintenance. Therefore, the CSB concludes that the bubbler tube was
likely bent on the morning of the incident during maintenance troubleshooting activities, likely between 8:20
a.m. and approximately 9:30 a.m. However, there was insufficient evidence to determine exactly when the tube
was bent. Therefore, the CSB was not able to determine precisely when the uncontrolled release began.
There was insufficient evidence to determine how the bubbler tube was bent. The CSB considered several
competing hypotheses, including 1) intentional or unintentional human manipulation of the tube by hand or
using various tools, 2) frozen product impacting the tube and bending it over time, and 3) a mass of frozen
product becoming wedged between the tube and the wall of the immersion freezer or the conveyor belt.
Various hypotheses were tested extensively by the CSB, Messer, and FFG. Though several of the tests produced
results similar to the as-found condition of the incident tube, none of the tests reproduced the exact state in
which the incident tube was found (such as the degree of the bend, the direction of the bend, or the presence or
absence of certain “witness marks,” which are specific impressions such as scratches and dents left in the metal).
As a result, the CSB was not able to definitively determine how the tube was bent.
There was also insufficient evidence to determine the actions that the two maintenance workers took during their
troubleshooting efforts, or the sequence of events that took place in the freezer room between when the freezer
31

Investigation Report
was turned over from operations to maintenance and when the Line 4 workers first identified the emergency.
Because it was impossible to determine 1) when and how the tube was bent, 2) what actions the maintenance
workers took, 3) whether the workers were aware of the bent tube, 4) whether the workers were aware of the
rising level of liquid nitrogen in the freezer, or 5) whether they were aware of the hazard that the rising liquid
level presented, the CSB could not determine whether the two maintenance workers had sufficient awareness,
time, and ability to avert the release by activating an E-stop or to escape the room safely prior to the loss of
containment. Messer trained the workers to operate and maintain the freezer, and thus the workers may have
been able to recognize the freezer’s improper function and may have been able to activate an E-stop to avert the
overflow. Ultimately, however, the CSB could not determine whether the workers were aware of the impending
release, and the workers did not activate an E-stop or escape the room.
The Maintenance Manager told the CSB that he manually closed the liquid nitrogen bulk storage tank discharge
valves (Section 2.2.2), but he was unable to identify at what time he did so. Based on his and others’ accounts of
events, and a 911 call he made at 10:18 a.m., the CSB estimates that the Maintenance Manager closed the valves
at approximately 10:15 a.m.a The CSB concludes that the uncontrolled release of liquid nitrogen likely ceased at
approximately 10:15 a.m. when the bulk storage tank manually-operated discharge valves, located outside the
building, were closed.
Messer reported that roughly 6,300 gallons of liquid nitrogen flowed to the Line 4 immersion-spiral freezer
combination between 8:21 a.m. and 10:51 a.m.b Not all the liquid nitrogen flow that Messer reported would have
released, as the system split the total flow between the immersion and the spiral freezers. The CSB concludes
that at most, approximately 6,300 gallons (approximately 42,400 pounds) of liquid nitrogen released from the
FFG Line 4 immersion freezer, though the actual released quantity was likely less. There was insufficient
evidence to determine the exact quantity of released liquid nitrogen because it was not possible to determine
when the release began.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation determined that all six fatally injured employees asphyxiated. As discussed
in Section 1.4, the freezer room was partially recessed, nearly fully enclosed below five feet of elevation, and
the room was ventilated only by the building’s make-up air system. Cold nitrogen vapors are heavier than air,
and numerous employees and first responders reported seeing a thick, visible cloud of vapor roughly four to five
feet high in the freezer room.c The CSB concludes that the released liquid nitrogen vaporized, collected in the
freezer room, and produced an oxygen-deficient atmosphere inside the room.
a
The freezer event log shows that the E-stop was activated at 10:36 a.m., and so at the latest, the uncontrolled flow of liquid nitrogen to
the immersion freezer would have ceased at 10:36 a.m. when the E-stop was activated.
b
A mass flow meter measured and totalized the liquid nitrogen flow once every 30 minutes.
c
Because nitrogen is not visible, the cloud seen by witnesses was the result of moisture in the air condensing due to the reduced
temperature caused by the release.

4 SAFETY ISSUES
The following sections discuss the safety issues contributing to the incident, which include:
• Single Point of Failure (Section 4.1);
• Atmospheric Monitoring and Alarm Systems (Section 4.2);
• Emergency Preparedness (Section 4.3);
• Process Safety Management System (Section 4.4); and
• Product Stewardship (Section 4.5).
33

Investigation Report
4.1 SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE
Processes and equipment handling hazardous chemicals should be robust enough such that the failure of a single
component does not result in a catastrophic incident. Regardless of how the bubbler tube became bent, designing
the freezer to avoid this single point of failure could have prevented this incident.
The CSB found that the freezer was not designed according to industry good practice guidance, that Linde’s
design-phase process hazards analysis (PHA) did not identify the single-point failure, and that during fabrication
of FFG’s immersion freezer, Messer did not detect a manufacturing defect—a missing second clamp meant to
secure the bubbler tube to the freezer—that exacerbated the bubbler tube’s vulnerability to deformation.
4.1.1 SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE
The design of the immersion freezer involved in the incident was such that the bubbler system used a single
bubbler tube device to measure liquid level, thus making the bubbler tube a safety-critical device. The bubbler
tube was the sole input to both the level control loop and the high-level safety interlock, which was configured
to stop the flow of liquid nitrogen to the immersion freezer in the event that the liquid reached an unsafe level.a
As a result, as shown above in Figure 14, when the bubbler tube was bent to the point where the end of the tube
was higher than the overflow level for the freezer, the liquid nitrogen level control system was unable to detect
or modulate the level of liquid in the freezer, and the high-level safety interlock designed to prevent overflow
from the equipment was defeated. The CSB concludes that the immersion freezer was designed such that the
failure of a single level measurement device could defeat both the nitrogen level control system and the
emergency interlock intended to stop nitrogen flow to the freezer. After the bubbler tube was bent, there was
nothing to prevent the nitrogen release from the freezer.
In general, systems should not be designed with single points of failure since, by definition, there would be no
other redundant or independent safety system available in case of failure. There are several industry guidance
documents that discuss this topic. The Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS) Guidelines for Safe and
Reliable Instrumented Protective Systems explains the decision-making processes for the management of
instrumented protective systems throughout a project’s life cycle [12].
The “Understanding Failure” section of the guidelines contains a discussion on common cause failure, a term
used to describe random and systematic events that cause multiple devices, systems, or layers to fail
simultaneously [12, p. 322]. According to the CCPS, there are essentially two types of common cause failures:
1) single points of failure where one malfunctioning device causes an instrumented protective functionb failure,
and 2) single events that lead to multiple failures in a redundant subsystem [12, p. 323]. Single point of failure
events can occur due to systematic failure events that result from human error or random failure events [12, p.
323]. These random failures are typically managed using redundancy and other means [12, p. 323].

Investigation Report
Instrumented Systems for the Process Industry Sector contains similar guidance regarding single points of
failure [13].
Redundant or independent safety systems, such as additional bubbler tube

4.1.2 LINDE’S DESIGN-PHASE PHA
Prior to the Messer-Linde acquisition in 2005, Linde performed a PHA on the general immersion-spiral freezer
design. The CCPS defines a PHA as an organized effort to identify and evaluate hazards associated with
processes and operations to enable their control [14]. According to CCPS, a PHA generally involves the use of
qualitative techniques to identify and assess the significance of hazards, followed by the development of
conclusions and recommendations to address the hazards. In addition to PHAs conducted on processes that are
already installed and operating, a PHA is often conducted during the design phase of a project in an effort to
identify potential hazards and the need for additional safeguards prior to fabricating the equipment.
4.1.2.1 Insufficient Safeguards
According to the completed PHA, potential process deviations for the immersion-spiral freezer identified by the
PHA team included high flow, high level, and loss of containment, among other deviations. Regarding causes of
these deviations,a the PHA lists several potential issues, including failure of the bubbler system, which could
consequently result in the release of liquid nitrogen from the immersion freezer. The safeguards identified to
mitigate the potential “bubbler failure” and other identified causes included a high-level alarm for the immersion
freezer, a low temperature alarm/shutdown, the assumed presence of atmospheric monitoring equipment, and
maintaining a preventative maintenance schedule on the components (Figure 15).
a
Potential causes of loss of containment from the immersion freezer and high level in the immersion freezer are linked to the potential
causes of high flow in the immersion freezer, which include temperature control system malfunction, I/P failure or miscalibration,
equipment malfunction – actuated supply/control valve, equipment malfunction – bubbler failure, and improper calibration of the
control valve.

Generally, a high-level alarm is a logical safeguard to prevent high flow, high level, and/or loss of containment.
However, in the event of the failure mode that occurred in this incident, it was ineffective because the damage to
the bubbler tube effectively disabled both the level control loop and the high-level safety alarm. Consequently,
the high-level alarm and interlock could not serve as a safeguard, as Linde intended. Further, the only other
identified safeguard against bubbler failure was the presence of atmospheric monitoring outside the freezer,
which FFG did not have. Even if FFG did have monitoring and alarm equipment, such systems could not have
prevented the damage to the bubbler system or liquid nitrogen from overflowing from the freezer; it could only
have reduced the severity or consequences of a release.
The CSB concludes that Linde did not adequately consider the failure of the liquid nitrogen level control system
and did not identify appropriate safeguards to mitigate the potential failure. In essence, Linde incorrectly
identified the bubbler tube as a safeguard for itself.
36

Investigation Report
4.1.2.2 PHA Technique
The CCPS publication Guidelines for Hazard Evaluation Procedures discusses risk-based determination of the
adequacy of safeguards identified using scenario-based hazard evaluation [15]. According to these guidelines,
safeguards should be analyzed to determine whether they are adequate to mitigate potential failures.
Determining the adequacy of safeguards is generally done by analyzing the risk associated with one scenario at
a time. The guidelines state:
The common element […] is the development of incident scenarios that are more
or less detailed time-sequence descriptions of unique initiating cause/loss event
combinations, sometimes termed “cause-consequence pairs.” Each initiating
cause might lead to more than one loss event […]; likewise, a given loss event
[…] might have various possible initiating causes. However, it is unique
initiating cause/loss event combinations that form the scenarios of interest […]
[15, p. 213].
Grouped Scenario Causes
Linde did not evaluate unique cause-consequence scenarios in its design-phase PHA. Instead, Linde grouped
potential causes of the identified process deviations together. This makes it inherently difficult to determine the
sequence of events leading from each cause to the consequence. In the absence of a clear sequence of events,
potential consequences and safeguards identified to protect against the impacts can vary depending on how the
scenario develops.
For example, “Improper calibration of control valve” and “Equipment malfunction – bubbler failure” can both
result in excess liquid nitrogen being introduced into the immersion freezer, resulting in an overflow of liquid
nitrogen. However, the safeguards to protect against each of the causes would be different (Figure 16). In the
case of a control valve malfunction, the high-level alarm/safety interlock would likely identify the hazard and
shut off liquid nitrogen supply to the freezer using separate shutoff valves, as shown in blue in Figure 16.
Yet, in the event of a bent bubbler tube, as was the failure mode in this incident, both the level control device
and high-level alarm/safety interlock would lose the ability to detect liquid nitrogen level in the immersion
freezer (illustrated in Figure 14). Therefore, the high-level alarm/safety interlock would not have been a valid
safeguard for the failure of the bubbler panel system or a bent bubbler tube, as shown in red in Figure 16. By
grouping potential causes together in this manner, a PHA team can lose sight of which safeguards protect
against which causes.
37

Investigation Report

safeguards. (Credit: Messer, annotations by CSB)
Generic Scenarios
There was also a lack of specificity in the causes identified in the PHA. For instance, the PHA generically listed
“Equipment malfunction – bubbler failure” as a cause of high flow, high level, and/or loss of containment from
the immersion freezer. However, there are several potential failure modes that could cause the bubbler tube to
fail to provide an accurate measurement to the level control loop and the high-level alarm/safety interlock. For
example, there could be incorrect pressure of the gaseous nitrogen being supplied to the bubbler tube, there
could be a leak in the fittings, the tubing could be plugged with solids, or the end of the bubbler tube could be
bent and not fully submerged in the liquid nitrogen, as was the case in this incident. Being specific with cause
descriptions would allow the PHA team to fully understand each scenario and analyze which safeguards would
be expected to function correctly in a particular scenario, and which could not be relied upon due to a common-
mode failure.
The CSB concludes that Linde did not identify specific incident scenarios or cause-consequence pairs when
conducting the PHA for the immersion-spiral freezer, which resulted in Linde’s failure to identify adequate
safeguards to protect against the overflow of liquid nitrogen from the immersion freezer.

Investigation Report
4.1.3 MANUFACTURING QUALITY CONTROL
The immersion freezera involved in this incident was fabricated in early 2016.b Once fabrication of the
immersion freezer was complete, the fabrication teamc completed a Quality Control inspection of the equipment
to ensure that it was fabricated in accordance with design specifications. Following completion of this Quality
Control inspection, the immersion freezer remained in Messer’s possession until FFG agreed to lease the freezer
from Messer in July 2020. Once FFG committed to leasing the equipment, Messer performed a “functional
checkout” of the immersion freezer in August 2020.
As discussed in Section 1.2, installation of the Line 4 immersion-spiral freezer began on December 5, 2020, and
was complete by December 16, 2020.
According to design specifications, the bubbler tube should have been secured to the interior wall of the
immersion freezer with two support clamps (Figure 17). Following the incident, however, the CSB found that
only one support clamp had been utilized to secure the bubbler tube to the interior of the immersion freezer
(Figure 18).

The missing support clamp was not identified in June 2016 when the initial Quality Control inspection of the
equipment was completed post-fabrication. The Quality Control Checkout form for the immersion freezer
includes a Bubbler Panel and Pan Purge section with several line item verifications related to the equipment.
One line item contained in this section directs the user to “check that all support clamps are in place.” The
completed form from June 2016 indicates that this line item was verified at the time of inspection (Figure 19).

clamps were in place at the time of June 2016 and August 2020 Quality Control
inspections. (Credit: Messer, annotations by CSB)
41

Investigation Report
After the incident, the Messer engineer who completed the inspection explained that the only line items related
to the bubbler tube assembly on the Quality Control Checkout form were bubbler panel and pan purge
components, all of which were located on the exterior of the immersion freezer. As a result, he did not believe
that this line item (the one indicated in Figure 19) included verification of the presence of the two support
clamps on the bubbler tube inside of the freezer. Additionally, he indicated that the line items on the Quality
Control Checkout form were meant to be completed in sequential order and that, at this point in the inspection,
the lid on the immersion freezer would have been closed.a As a result, it would have been impossible to ensure
that the two support clamps on the bubbler tube were in place as part of this line item instruction. The Messer
engineer indicated that there was no instruction on the Quality Control Checkout form that specifically directed
him to verify the presence of the two interior support clamps on the bubbler tube. Additionally, Messer’s
process did not appear to involve cross-checking the freezer as built against the engineering drawings (excerpted
in Figure 17). Doing so would have presented another opportunity for the quality control inspector to detect the
missing clamp. The CSB concludes that Messer’s Quality Control procedures and practices were ineffective in
ensuring that the two support clamps on the bubbler tube were in place at the time of inspection. As a result,
Messer failed to identify the missing support clamp during Quality Control inspection.b
Following this incident, Messer examined another immersion freezer that was fabricated at the same time as the
freezer involved in this incident. Inspection of this freezer revealed that, similar to the freezer involved in the
incident, the bubbler tube was secured to the interior of the freezer by a single support clamp. The bubbler tube
was also found to be bent, though to a lesser degree than the bubbler tube in the freezer at FFG.
Messer later completed a survey of 14 additional immersion freezers to determine whether the bubbler tubes in
any of these freezers were either bent or damaged, or secured using a single clamp configuration. As a result of
this survey, Messer discovered two additional damaged bubbler tubes, both of which were secured by two
support clamps, as designed. No other single support clamp configurations were identified.
While any length of unsecured tubing is susceptible to physical damage and movement, the combination of
unsecured tubing length and support clamp location directly affects to what degree the tubing can be bent.
Consequently, the CSB concludes that the combination of unsecured tubing length and support clamp location
worsened the potential for the bubbler tube to become bent, which ultimately resulted in the bubbler system
becoming non-functional.c
4.1.4 MESSER POST-INCIDENT ACTIONS
Following the incident, Messer implemented several changes to its existing immersion freezer design. The
changes are intended to provide additional layers of protection against the possibility of an overflow of liquid
nitrogen. Among the additional layers of protection are 1) a dual bubbler panel system with two independent
bubbler tubes, constructed of schedule 80 piping to provide increased resistance to displacement, 2) an external
resistance temperature detector (RTD) located on the horizontal portion of the freezer inlet, intended to detect

After the incident, Messer revised its Quality Control process and procedures to require verification of the presence of the bubbler tube
clamps and reordered the sequence of inspection steps to facilitate this verification. Consequently, the CSB makes no recommendation
to Messer regarding its Quality Control process.
c
After the incident Messer revised its freezer design such that it now includes multiple layers of protection against liquid nitrogen
overflow. Consequently, as noted below, the CSB makes no recommendation to Messer regarding the design of its immersion freezers.

the presence of cryogenic liquid and activate safety interlocks, 3) changes to the programmable logic controller
to accommodate for the additional bubbler panel and RTD, and 4) vaporization of liquid nitrogen to gaseous
nitrogen for use in the bubbler systems at the bulk storage tanks rather than at the freezer equipment.
Because Messer’s freezer design now includes multiple layers of protection against liquid nitrogen overflow, the
CSB makes no recommendation to Messer regarding the design of its immersion freezers.
Messer has also revised its Quality Control process and procedures to require verification of the presence of the
bubbler tube clamps and re-ordered the sequence of inspection steps to facilitate this verification. Therefore, the
CSB makes no recommendation to Messer regarding its Quality Control process.
4.2 ATMOSPHERIC MONITORING AND ALARM SYSTEMS
Atmospheric monitoring and alarm systems provide important mitigative protection against hazards in the
atmosphere when preventive measures fail to contain the hazardous materials inside a process. Fixed
atmospheric monitoring and alarm systems are essential for preventing people from entering unsafe
environments, such as areas affected by uncontrolled liquid nitrogen releases. To effectively implement these
safety-critical systems, it is necessary to assess application-specific and site-specific conditions.
Liquid nitrogen rapidly expands when it evaporates, and in a poorly ventilated area, nitrogen gas can quickly
displace oxygen, creating an oxygen-deficient atmosphere (Section 1.6.1). When people breathe in air that does
not have enough oxygen, immediate effects, including unconsciousness after only one or two breaths, and
ultimately death, can occur (Section 1.6.2). The exposed person has no warning and cannot sense that the
oxygen level is too low [8, p. 2]. Therefore, active monitoring of the oxygen concentration in areas where
oxygen deficiency may occur, with an associated audible and visual alarm to alert people to the hazard, is a
common and effective strategy to prevent worker exposure to hazardous atmospheres [16, p. 68].
4.2.1 ATMOSPHERIC MONITORING AND ALARMS AT FFG
Absence of monitoring and alarms on Line 2
FFG had operated a liquid nitrogen spiral freezer on Line 2 beginning in May 2020 (Section 1.2). FFG and
Messer divided their responsibilities according to the chart shown in Figure 5 (Section 1.5). The task
responsibility chart did not specifically mention atmospheric monitoring.
During the Line 2 freezer installation, Messer conducted several training and product stewardship activities with
maintenance technicians and the packaging supervisor using a checklist titled the “Food Projects Checklist.”a
The checklist included specific items that each referenced atmospheric monitoring in some way, including:
a
This checklist documented Messer’s customer stewardship practices by providing customer interface with the necessary training and
documentation on the equipment and liquid nitrogen.
43

Investigation Report
• transmitting the Safety Data Sheet (SDS)a for liquid nitrogen to FFG. The SDS mentioned the use of
atmospheric monitoring as a safety precaution;
• discussing the availability of additional resources for safe handling, such as guidance from the
Compressed Gas Association (CGA), the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), and OSHA,
each of which, to varying extents, mention the need for atmospheric monitoring;
• submitting Line 2 freezer operation and maintenance manuals to FFG (which mentioned the use of
atmospheric monitoring); and,
• a line item directing Messer to discuss atmospheric monitoring with FFG. The checklist box for
atmospheric monitoring did not indicate a “Yes” for verification like the others for completion but
instead was blank.
This checklist was completed and signed by FFG and Messer on May 19, 2020.
Messer recommended, via its SDS, that its liquid nitrogen customers implement oxygen detection systems at
their facilities. The SDS stated that “oxygen detectors should be used when asphyxiating gases may be released”
as an appropriate engineering control.
The Line 2 spiral freezer PHA,b conducted by a Messer predecessor, identified that a loss of containment of
liquid nitrogen could result in oxygen deficiency and personal injury. Among other safeguards, the PHA listed
the use of atmospheric monitors as a recommended safeguard. This PHA was not shared with FFG and was not
specific to FFG’s process and facility, but it shows that Messer had institutional knowledge about the need for
atmospheric monitoring.
Despite the actions discussed above, FFG did not install atmospheric monitoring and alarm equipment on the
Line 2 liquid nitrogen spiral freezer.
In August 2020, after visiting the FFG plant, a Messer employee emailed the FFG Senior Vice President of
Operations to express concern and to highlight the absence of atmospheric monitoring equipment at an area of
the plant adjacent to Line 2. The email stated:
We highly recommend the use of permanently mounted Oxygen […] monitors
augmented with the use of personal/portable monitors as part of the plant’s safety
system.
I have attached a gas monitor letter with recommended manufacturers of
monitors.
FFG did not respond to the email.
a
The Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200(g)), revised in 2012, requires that the chemical manufacturer, distributor, or
importer SDSs (formerly MSDSs or Material Safety Data Sheets) for each hazardous chemical to downstream users to communicate
information on these hazards. The SDS includes information such as the properties of each chemical; the physical, health, and
environmental health hazards; protective measures; and safety precautions for handling, storing, and transporting the chemical.
b
The PHA was conducted in 2004 by BOC, which was eventually acquired by Linde and subsequently Messer.

Investigation Report
Absence of monitoring and alarms on Line 4
When FFG installed the Line 4 immersion-spiral freezer, Messer and FFG documented the same task
responsibility chart for Line 4 as they did for Line 2. As with Line 2, the chart included no specific mention of
atmospheric monitoring, though several of the tasks included information that mentioned the need. After the
incident, FFG management told the CSB that they were unaware of the need for atmospheric monitoring.
Conversely, Messer told the CSB, that “it was communicated to them [FFG] that they needed to have an
[oxygen] monitor.” Ultimately, neither FFG nor Messer installed atmospheric monitoring and alarm equipment
in the Line 4 freezer room or on the freezer equipment.
Messer believed that at the time, it had no legal or contractual obligation to install atmospheric monitoring and
alarm systems at FFG; nor did contemporary guidance from the CGA, further discussed below in Section
4.2.2.3, require the use of such systems at FFG (although they were recommended). Contractual or legal
obligations aside, in terms of safety, whether it was FFG’s or Messer’s responsibility to install atmospheric
monitoring and alarm systems is irrelevant; both companies could have and should have taken action to
maximize the safety of the FFG Line 4 freezer operation.
In summary, the CSB concludes that Messer informed FFG of the need for atmospheric monitoring of its liquid
nitrogen processes on at least three occasions. Despite Messer’s recommendations, neither FFG nor Messer took
action to install monitoring or alarm equipment on the Line 4 process, which could have alerted workers to the
presence of an oxygen-deficient atmosphere, and, if designed accordingly, could have triggered an emergency
shutdown of the liquid nitrogen systems.
As discussed in Section 1.1.1, Gold Creek currently owns and operates the former FFG facility. As of this
report’s publication, there are currently no liquid nitrogen freezing processes at the former FFG Plant 4 building
which Gold Creek now operates. Therefore, the CSB does not issue a recommendation to Gold Creek related to
atmospheric monitoring or ventilation of liquid nitrogen processes.
4.2.2 EXISTING INDUSTRY GUIDANCE FOR ATMOSPHERIC MONITORING
AND ALARM SYSTEMS
The risk of oxygen-deficient atmospheres is well understood, and there is a wealth of guidance available,
discussed below, that if followed, could have helped reduce the severity of this incident.
4.2.2.1 CSB Guidance
In June 2003, the CSB published a Nitrogen Asphyxiation Safety Bulletin.a The bulletin states [8, pp. 6-8]:
The atmosphere in a small, enclosed area may be unfit for breathing prior to
entry, or it may change over time, depending on the type of equipment or work
being performed. Recognizing this hazard, good practice calls for continuous
monitoring of an enclosed area to detect oxygen-deficient atmospheres.

Investigation Report
[…]
Warning and protection devices, if properly installed and maintained, warn
workers of hazardous atmospheres.
The safe handling of nitrogen, described above, is effective only if personnel are
trained on the importance of atmospheric monitoring equipment—both how to
use it and how to determine when it is not working properly. Personnel should
be trained on how to properly respond and evacuate in the event of failure of the
system.
4.2.2.2 CCPS Guidance
The CCPS book Continuous Monitoring for Hazardous Material Releases provides guidance on the use of
indoor atmospheric monitoring [17, pp. 63-64]:
There are occasions when process equipment must be located indoors due to
weather-related or quality control issues. Combustible [and oxygen]a gas
detection should be provided in these buildings […]. This detection should be
configured to:
• Send an alarm signal to a continuously manned location
• Activate visible and audible alarm devices on the exterior of the
building at each entranceway and within the structure. The devices
within the structure should be configured using the guidance for fire
alarm devices, as provided in NFPA 72, National Fire Alarm and
Signaling Code
In some cases, it may also be advantageous for the detection system to initiate an
automatic shutdown and/or isolation of the potential release sources within the
structure. […] In many cases, remote-operated shutdown and isolation systems
and/or remotely located isolation means will suffice.b
4.2.2.3 Compressed Gas Association Guidance
The CGA has numerous guidelines and publications that address many aspects of the safe handling of industrial
gases, including the safe handling of cryogenic liquids, storage of compressed gases in containers, and oxygen-
deficient atmospheres.
a
Although this excerpt concerns atmospheric monitoring for combustible gases, the guidance is equally applicable to toxic gases or to
oxygen-deficiency hazards.
b
The ISA Technical Report ISA-TR84.00.07, Guidance on the Evaluation of Fire, Combustible Gas, and Toxic Gas System Effectiveness
[55] offers actionable guidance on the design and implementation of atmospheric monitoring and automated emergency shutdown
systems.

Investigation Report
CGA P-12 Guideline for Safe Handling of Cryogenic and Refrigerated Liquids
CGA P-12 is intended to provide “general information about the properties, transportation, storage, safe
handling, and safe use of the cryogenic and refrigerated liquids commonly used by industry and institutions. It is
intended for cryogenic and refrigerated liquid users, shippers, carriers, distributors, equipment designers or
installers, safety administrators, and anyone seeking an introduction to cryogenic and refrigerated liquids [18, p.
1].”
At the time of the incident, the standard stated:
If low oxygen atmospheres are possible, installation of analyzers equipped with
alarms should be used to monitor the oxygen content. Whenever personnel enter
enclosed areas, the breathing atmosphere shall be constantly monitored by
appropriate instrumentation [5, p. 17] (emphasis added).
In January 2023, CGA issued the seventh edition of CGA P-12, which updated the following language
concerning oxygen monitoring from “should be” to “shall be” [18, pp. 8, 11]:a
Areas where an oxygen-deficient atmosphere can occur shall be monitored by
an area monitoring system, [personal atmospheric monitoring systems],b or a
combination of the two as determined by a hazard assessment [18, p. 8]
(emphasis added).
If low oxygen atmospheres are possible as determined by a hazard assessment,
installation of analyzers equipped with alarms shall be used to monitor the
oxygen content. Whenever personnel enter enclosed areas, the breathing
atmosphere shall be constantly monitored by appropriate instrumentation [18, p.
11] (emphasis added).
CGA P-18 Standard for Bulk Inert Gas Systems
According to the CGA:
This standard contains minimum requirements for locating/siting, selecting
equipment, installing, starting up, maintaining, and removing bulk inert gas
supply systems [19, p. 1].
The CGA defines the boundary of a bulk inert supply system:
The bulk inert supply system terminates at the source valve, where the gas or
liquid supply first enters the supply line [19, p. 1].
a
The change in this guideline from “should be” to “shall be” was made after the FFG incident in 2021.
b
Personal atmospheric monitoring systems are typically body-mounted or hand-held atmospheric monitoring equipment, as opposed to
fixed or permanently mounted atmospheric monitors.
47

Investigation Report
The standard states:
Indoor areas where bulk inert gas systems are installed shall be continuously
monitored with an atmosphere monitoring system. The system shall provide an
audible and visual alarm when the oxygen level drops to 19.5%. The alarm shall
be located inside the area and immediately outside of all entrances to the indoor
area. The atmosphere monitoring system also shall send a signal to a central
monitoring station or a continuously occupied location if one is provided on-site.
Design of the monitoring system shall allow for routine testing to demonstrate
functionality [19, p. 17] (emphasis added).
It should be noted that this requirement applies to bulk storage systems that are installed indoors, and not to
application equipment such as FFG’s immersion freezer, or to bulk storage systems installed outdoors, as was
the case at FFG. However, CGA P-18 is among the many pieces of guidance issued by the CGA highlighting the
importance of using atmospheric monitoring when the potential for an oxygen-deficient atmosphere exists.
CGA P-76 Hazards of Oxygen-Deficient Atmospheres
Relevant guidance from CGA P-76 includes:
In processes where cryogenic liquids are handled and vaporization takes place,
care shall be taken to avoid situations where personnel are exposed to oxygen
deficiency [6, p. 5].
The standard contains a list of examples of such spaces, and among the various examples, rooms containing
liquid nitrogen food freezers are explicitly identified [6, p. 5].
There are a number of situations where the need for ventilation or atmospheric
monitoring shall be assessed in order to avoid asphyxiation incidents from inert
gases and/or oxygen depletion.
The occurrence of an oxygen-deficient atmosphere within an area depends upon
the ventilation of the area, the volume of the space, and how much gas flow (flow
rate or quantity) could be released. From this consideration, a risk assessment
shall be carried out and suitable control measure implemented to reach the
expected level of safety [6, p. 7].
Consideration should also be given to the use of workplace atmospheric
monitoring, for example, wearing a personal oxygen analyzer or installing an
analyzer in the work area. The location of the monitor shall be based on an
assessment […] [6, p. 8] (emphasis added).
48

Investigation Report
4.2.2.4 International Code Council Guidance
The International Code Council (ICC) [20] authors the International Fire Code (IFC). The IFC contains
guidance for both compressed gases and cryogenic liquids, including those that are not flammable or
combustible. With regard to atmospheric monitoring for compressed gases, the IFC states:
Gas detection system. In rooms or areas not provided with ventilation […], a
gas detection system [or] an oxygen depletion alarm system, either of which
initiates audible and visible alarm signals in the room or area where sensors are
installed, shall be provided [21, pp. 53-7].a
This guidance did not apply to FFG’s liquid nitrogen system because the IFC only applies it to compressed
gases. Regarding the use of atmospheric monitoring for cryogenic liquids, the standard states:
Inert cryogenic fluids, including argon, helium and nitrogen, shall comply with
ANSI/CGA P-18 [21, pp. 55-1].b
4.2.2.5 NFPA Guidance
Concerning the use of cryogenic fluids, NFPA 55, Compressed Gases and Cryogenic Fluids Code states:
Storage, use, and handling of inert cryogenic fluids shall be in accordance with
ANSI/CGA P-18, Standard for Bulk Inert Gas Systems at Consumer Sites [22,
pp. 55-35].c
NFPA 55 contains guidance on the use of atmospheric monitoring for corrosive gases,d toxic and highly toxic
gases,e hydrogen,f carbon dioxide,g ethylene oxide,h and acetylene,i but not for cryogenic asphyxiants such as
liquid nitrogen.
4.2.2.6 Lack of Adherence to Industry Guidance
Despite industry guidance, FFG did not equip the Line 4 freezer room with an atmospheric monitoring system
that would continuously monitor for a breathable atmosphere and notify personnel by alarms to evacuate the
area if unsafe. Not implementing such a system resulted in at least 14 employees entering or approaching the
oxygen-deficient atmosphere on the day of the incident. FFG workers were not trained on the hazards of
oxygen-deficient atmospheres (Section 4.4.1.5). Without atmospheric monitoring and alarms, site personnel

future incidents involving cryogenic asphyxiants.
Need for Harmonization of CGA Standards
As noted earlier, both CGA P-12 and CGA P-18 guidelines require atmospheric monitoring in areas where an
oxygen-deficient atmosphere can occur. However, CGA P-76 describes the use of such systems as a
consideration rather than a requirement.
The CSB recommends that the CGA update CGA P-76 to require that atmospheric monitoring systems shall be
utilized with processes, equipment, and piping systems capable of producing oxygen-deficient atmospheres, and
to require that atmospheric monitoring systems provide both visible and audible alarm indication distinct from
the building’s fire alarm system at a continuously attended location.
Gap in ICC and NFPA Cryogenic Fluids Guidance
The IFC and NFPA 55 both contain guidance for using and handling compressed gases and cryogenic fluids. In
both standards, the guidance for the use of compressed gases is extensive, and for the use of atmospheric
monitoring for compressed gases, both standards’ guidance is typically either prescriptive or required as an
alternative to adequate ventilation, depending on the characteristics of the compressed gas and the application.
This guidance could have reduced the severity of this incident had it applied to cryogenic asphyxiants like liquid
nitrogen and been applied at FFG. Instead, for the use of atmospheric monitoring with liquid nitrogen, both
standards simply refer to CGA P-18 Standard for Bulk Inert Gas Systems and otherwise contain no specific
guidance regarding atmospheric monitoring for liquid nitrogen.
CGA P-18 only covers the bulk storage of inert gases and cryogenic liquids, not the end use of equipment such
as the FFG Line 4 immersion-spiral freezer, and therefore the standard did not apply to the FFG immersion

freezer or the room in which it was located. There is thus a gap in NFPA’s and ICC’s coverage of atmospheric
monitoring for cryogenic asphyxiants including liquid nitrogen. The NFPA and the ICC should close this gap.
The CSB recommends that the ICC update the International Fire Code to require the use of atmospheric
monitoring with cryogenic asphyxiants in accordance with industry guidance such as is contained in CGA P-76
Hazards of Oxygen-Deficient Atmospheres and CGA P-12 Safe Handling of Cryogenic Liquids in addition to
CGA P-18 Standard for Bulk Inert Gas Systems.
The CSB recommends that NFPA update its Compressed Gases and Cryogenic Fluids Code to require the use
of atmospheric monitoring with cryogenic asphyxiants in accordance with industry guidance such as is
contained in CGA P-76 Hazards of Oxygen-Deficient Atmospheres and CGA P-12 Safe Handling of Cryogenic
Liquids in addition to CGA P-18 Standard for Bulk Inert Gas Systems.
Need for a Comprehensive Liquid Nitrogen Standard
The CGA has established guidelines for the safe production, storage, transportation, handling, and use of
gaseous, liquid, and solid carbon dioxide, an asphyxiant with hazards similar to liquid nitrogen. CGA G-6.5,
Standard for Small Stationary Insulated Carbon Dioxide Systems,a serves as a comprehensive standard for
carbon dioxide application systems [23, p. 1].b CGA G-6.5 discusses the implementation of key asphyxiation
hazard safeguards, including:
• the location and required maintenance of atmospheric monitors [23, pp. 7-8, 10];
• requirements for visual and audible alarms in response to an oxygen-deficient atmosphere [23, p. 9];
• design, function, and location of room ventilation systems [23, p. 6];
• PPE requirements for entering an oxygen-deficient atmosphere caused by the presence of carbon
dioxide [23, p. 6];
• hazards introduced by installing carbon dioxide systems in enclosed, recessed, and unventilated spaces
[23, p. 8]; and,
• Entry restrictions to areas with potential for oxygen-deficient atmospheres [23, p. 15].
Despite the general guidance from CGA mentioned elsewhere in this report, no equivalent comprehensive
standard exists specifically for liquid nitrogen application systems. CGA G-6.5 presents several critical
safeguards equally applicable for both carbon dioxide and liquid nitrogen systems with asphyxiation risks, as
discussed below.
a
The CSB chose CGA G-6.5, Standard for Small Stationary Insulated Carbon Dioxide Systems as an example comprehensive standard
due to the similar natures of cryogenic liquid carbon dioxide and nitrogen, and their similar use in the food industry. Specifically, the
small stationary standard for carbon dioxide systems addresses operations like those facilities with nitrogen systems at chicken
processing facilities—as opposed to a similar standard for large systems, CGA G-6.1 Standard for Large Insulated Liquid Carbon
Dioxide Systems at User Sites.
b
The IFC also provides comparable guidance for carbon dioxide systems in Section 5307.3 Insulated liquid carbon dioxide systems used
in beverage dispensing applications.

Investigation Report
Regarding the requirement for alarmed atmospheric monitoring, CGA G-6.5 states:
A carbon dioxide detector with an appropriate alarm system shall be installed
where dangerous concentrations of carbon dioxide can accumulate […] [23, p.
6] (emphasis added);
A carbon dioxide monitoring system with appropriate visual and/or audible alarm
shall be installed to detect dangerous concentrations of carbon dioxide [23, p. 9]
(emphasis added);
The carbon dioxide leak detection system when activated shall sound an audible
alarm within the room or area in which the system is installed. Gas detection
systems shall be installed and maintained in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions [23, p. 10] (emphasis added); and
Installed carbon dioxide monitors should be checked according to the carbon
dioxide monitor manufacturer’s guidelines for proper operation and inspection
frequency […]. Ensure placement of carbon dioxide monitors and warning signs
meet the [local] requirements [23, p. 15].
With regard to locating cryogenic asphyxiant equipment in enclosed areas and the critical need for properly
installed ventilation, CGA G-6.5 states:
Enclosed, improperly ventilated areas can include […] outside locations such as
one with four solid walls open to the atmosphere. Even if there is no roof or
ceiling this is still considered an enclosed space because the carbon dioxide will
not disperse as it is heavier than air [23, p. 7];
Ventilation systems shall exhaust from the lowest level with the make-up air
entering at a higher point.a Make up and exhaust rate of flow shall meet code
requirements [23, p. 6];
Standard commercial HVAC systems or additional fans typically do not provide
sufficient protection […] for carbon dioxide ventilation [23, p. 6]; and
[O]penings […] shall be spaced to create cross ventilation and located as low as
possible to ensure that carbon dioxide will not pool and cause exposure to
occupants. Any installation that does not meet these criteria should be considered
an enclosed installation [23, p. 8].
The CSB concludes that industry guidance for carbon dioxide is extensive. Comparable, specific guidance for
liquid nitrogen could help prevent future incidents similar to the one at FFG.
a
Carbon dioxide is heavier than air and accumulates at low points, similar to cold, vaporized liquid nitrogen.
52

Investigation Report
Consequently, the CSB recommends that the CGA develop a comprehensive standard for the safe storage,
handling, and use of liquid nitrogen in stationary applications, comparable to the guidance presented in CGA G-
6.5 Standard for Small Stationary Insulated Carbon Dioxide Systems. At a minimum, the standard should
include:
a) requirements for and guidance on the location, the maintenance, and the functional testing of
atmospheric monitoring devices;
b) requirements for visual and audible alarms distinct from the building’s fire alarm system and at a
continuously attended location; and,
c) guidance on the sizing, design, function, periodic maintenance and testing, and location of room and
emergency ventilation systems.

Investigation Report
4.3 EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
Effective emergency preparedness can reduce the consequences of a catastrophic incident. FFG had no
emergency action plan (EAP) for a liquid nitrogen release, did not train its employees on how to recognize or
respond to such a release, and did not equip them to safely respond.
4.3.1 REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
EPCRA
The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which is a portion of the Superfund
Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), establishes many requirements for community emergency
preparedness [24]. Because FFG utilized more than 10,000 pounds of liquid nitrogen, Sections 311-312 of
EPCRA required FFG to submit certain information to local emergency response organizations.
Under EPCRA, FFG was required to 1) submit an SDS for liquid nitrogen to local response organizations, and
2) submit an annual report to those organizations detailing, among other requirements, that FFG utilized liquid
nitrogen, its inventory of liquid nitrogen, and where and how at its facility liquid nitrogen was utilized.
OSHA HAZWOPER
OSHA’s Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) regulation (found at 29 CFR
1910.120) requires under § 1910.120(q)(1) that employers develop an emergency response plan (ERP). Under §
1910.120(q)(2), the regulation requires, among other things, that ERPs contain provisions for:
• pre-planning and coordination with outside response organizations;
• emergency recognition and prevention;
• emergency alerting and response procedures;
• employee training such that only trained employees respond to an emergency; and,
• PPE and emergency equipment.
The applicability of the HAZWOPER standard is not limited to substances covered under OSHA’s PSM
standard. OSHA, on its website,a has a flowchart for use in determining whether an incident requires emergency
response. According to the flowchart, an incident involving liquid nitrogen, which can create an oxygen-
deficient atmosphere, requires either emergency response under HAZWOPER or evacuation under 29 CFR
1910.38.

Investigation Report
4.3.2 INEFFECTIVE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
FFG Emergency Action Plan
FFG’s EAP consisted of a 46-page slideshow presentation written in English.a The EAP contained the following
material:
• Evacuation routes and rally points specific to each building at the facility
• General exit route safety requirements, such as the requirement for an adequate number of available
routes, that routes have adequate signage, and that routes be kept clear of obstacles that might hinder use
• Shelter-in-place locations
• Safety shower and eyewash station locations
• The requirement that “designated personnel will perform rescue […] medical and first aid duties”
• Incident reporting requirements
FFG’s EAP did not mention liquid nitrogen. Other than general evacuation and shelter-in-place directions, the
plan contained no guidance to employees on how, whether, or when to respond to an emergency, or what
constituted an emergency. The plan did call for “designated personnel” to perform rescue and first aid duties,
but in a response to a CSB information request, FFG wrote that:
FFG has no employees trained or qualified to perform rescue duties nor first aid
duties. When the need arises we would call 911 for assistance from the [fire
department].
The CSB found no evidence that FFG had any formalized policies or procedures for responding to a liquid
nitrogen release. The CSB concludes that although FFG had a written emergency action plan, it was severely
inadequate to address a liquid nitrogen emergency. Its inadequacies included 1) that it was not written in
Spanish, the primary language of many of FFG’s workers; 2) that it made no mention of the existence of liquid
nitrogen at the facility; 3) that it made no mention of the hazards of liquid nitrogen; 4) that it had no instructions
for how, whether, or when to respond to a release of liquid nitrogen other than general evacuation instructions;
5) that it contained no information or plan for how employees were to be notified of an emergency; 6) that it
contained no information on what constituted an emergency or what types of emergencies to which employees
might need to respond; and 7) that it had no provision for proactively interacting with local emergency
responders despite the company’s stated practice of relying on them for emergency response.
Lack of Warning and Poor Emergency Communication
As discussed above, FFG had no atmospheric monitoring systems or alarms to alert employees to a release of
liquid nitrogen or the presence of an oxygen-deficient atmosphere (Section 4.2.1). The result was that many of
a
The overwhelming majority of the FFG Plant 4 workforce, including five of the six fatally injured workers, were either non-English
speaking or spoke English as a non-primary language.
55

Investigation Report
the employees responding to the incident or evacuating the facility had no idea what the emergency was; only
that some of their coworkers were missing. Further, news of the emergency and the order to evacuate was only
spread by word of mouth, rather than by a plant-wide alarm or notification system, which did not exist at the
facility (other than the building’s fire alarm). The CSB concludes that as a result of FFG’s poor emergency
communication, employees attempting to respond to the incident or evacuate the building were only minimally
informed, if at all, of the nature and severity of the emergency.
Delay in Emergency Notification
There was a delay in notification to the fire department. FFG began the building evacuation at roughly 9:55
a.m., but the first call to 911 was not until 10:11 a.m. (Section 2.2.2).
One of the fatally injured workers was still alive when she was retrieved by firefighters but died shortly
thereafter in the hospital emergency department. Table 2 below summarizes the response timeline with respect
to this fatally injured worker. Prompt notification to emergency responders is critical in emergencies and might
have prevented the death of this worker.

Unprepared Workforce
FFG employees at all levels of the organization were unaware of either the existence of liquid nitrogen at the
facility, the hazards of liquid nitrogen, or both (Table 3, Section 4.4.1.5). In addition to this widespread lack of
awareness of the presence and hazards of liquid nitrogen, multiple employees told the CSB that the company did
not conduct any drills for a liquid nitrogen release or fire.
Four additional employees perished (including the employee who died at the hospital) and three were seriously
injured during the response to the liquid nitrogen release and the evacuation. None of these employees normally
56

Investigation Report
worked in the Line 4 freezer room, and their normal evacuation routes from the facility would not have taken
them through the freezer room. The CSB concludes that the four workers who subsequently were fatally injured
were attempting some sort of response to the release. The CSB found no evidence that FFG trained its
employees not to respond to emergencies. In addition to not mentioning liquid nitrogen or its hazards, FFG’s
EAP slideshow, shown to employees upon initial hiring, did not direct employees not to respond and instead
simply contained instructions on how to evacuate the building. In post-incident statements provided to OSHA, a
few workers (fewer than 10) told OSHA that they had watched a video or had been told by supervisors in the
past to evacuate the building during an emergency, but none of them mentioned liquid nitrogen in those
statements, and most of the workers’ statements focused on fire or weather emergencies.
Several FFG employeesa who were exposed to the oxygen-deficient atmosphere but survived the incident told
the CSB that they were directly investigating or otherwise responding to the incident when they were injured or
nearly injured, despite lacking any training or equipmentb to safely do so. One of them lost consciousness and
was rescued by other responding employees; he spent two days recovering in the hospital. Another reported
bending down to attempt to rescue another employee (the worker discussed above in Table 2), feeling dizzy and
disoriented, and nearly fainting before escaping under his own power.c Multiple other employees who reported
responding to the incident were not injured or sustained minor injuries. However, any of them could easily have
been seriously or fatally injured. In total, at least 14 employees (roughly 10% of the workforce at the facility)
responded to the liquid nitrogen release: four of them were fatally injured,d three were seriously injured, and at
least seven were uninjured or sustained minor injuries.
The CSB concludes that FFG did not prepare its workforce in any meaningful way to respond to a release of
liquid nitrogen. The company’s deficiencies included 1) its lack of emergency response training for its
workforce, 2) its lack of employee training on how to identify a liquid nitrogen release, 3) the lack of automated
means to detect and inform its workers of a liquid nitrogen release, and 4) insufficient direction to its employees
not to respond or attempt rescue during a liquid nitrogen release.
As a result of FFG’s unpreparedness, the severity of the incident was greatly increased during evacuation and
response activities when four additional employees were fatally injured, three employees were seriously injured,
and at least seven others sustained minor injuries or were uninjured but easily could have been seriously or
fatally injured. Had FFG effectively prepared its workforce for a liquid nitrogen release, the four additional
fatalities and three of the four serious injuries could have been prevented.e
a
The CSB is aware of at least seven employees who responded in some way but were either uninjured or not seriously injured.
b
FFG had no equipment or PPE that would have enabled workers to enter an oxygen-deficient atmosphere, such as supplied air systems
or SCBA.
c
This employee (the Plant 4 Maintenance Manager) very nearly asphyxiated during his attempted response. However, because he was
not admitted to the hospital, his injuries were not considered “serious” according to the CSB’s injury reporting requirements. Although
he is not counted among the four serious injuries (three employees and a firefighter) that resulted from this incident, this employee
could have easily died.
d
These are in addition to the two maintenance workers who died initially.
e
The fourth serious injury was suffered by a firefighter responding to the incident, and this injury likely would have occurred regardless
of any action taken by FFG other than preventing the release altogether.
57

Investigation Report
4.3.3 POST-INCIDENT ACTIONS – EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
The CSB requested information from Gold Creek pertaining to its emergency preparedness policies and
procedures. Gold Creek submitted a policy document titled Emergency Action Program and several emergency
procedures. The emergency procedures offer checklist-style instructions for Gold Creek’s facilities in the event
of fire, tornado, ammonia release, liquid nitrogen release, earthquake, and other emergencies. Each of the
emergency procedures is written in both English and Spanish.
The CSB concludes that Gold Creek’s policy documents and emergency procedures are more robust than FFG’s
emergency action plan was at the time of the incident and could have reduced the severity of this incident had
FFG implemented similar policies and procedures. Consequently, the CSB makes no recommendations to Gold
Creek pertaining to the development of emergency preparedness policies or procedures. However, policies and
procedures must be effectively implemented and communicated in relevant languages. Gold Creek’s EAP
includes provisions for training at initial hiring, with annual refresher trainings at minimum. Therefore, the CSB
makes no recommendation to Gold Creek pertaining to employee training for its EAP.
Gold Creek’s emergency action program, like FFG’s before it, relies upon local emergency responders to
perform firefighting, rescue, and medical duties during liquid nitrogen releases and other emergencies.
However, the policy has no provision for interaction with those local responders to inform them of and prepare
them for the emergencies to which Gold Creek expects them to respond. Therefore, the CSB recommends to
Gold Creek to include in its emergency action program provisions for proactively interacting with and informing
local emergency response resources of all emergencies at the former FFG Plant 4 facility to which Gold Creek
expects them to respond. At a minimum, Gold Creek should:
a) inform local emergency responders of the existence, nature, and location of hazardous substances at its
facilities, including liquid nitrogen;
b) inform local emergency responders of the location of emergency-critical equipment such as bulk storage
tanks, points of use, isolation valves, E-stop switches, and any other emergency equipment or systems
with which emergency responders may need to interact; and,
c) provide local emergency responders with information, such as facility plot plans, engineering drawings,
or other information needed to mount an effective emergency response.
4.3.4 EMERGENCY STOPS
As shown below in Figure 20, the FFG Line 4 freezer room was equipped with 10 E-stop buttons, which were
designed to shut down the immersion and spiral freezers as well as to close the liquid nitrogen supply valves to
the freezers.
58

Investigation Report

As shown, the 10 E-stop buttons consisted of five buttons on each freezer; one on either side of the inlet and
outlet of each freezer, and one on each HMI panel. All 10 buttons were located within the freezer room. The
result of this placement was that activation of any of the E-stop buttons required someone to approach the source
of the release to activate an E-stop. As stated earlier, FFG had no employees equipped for or trained in
emergency response, and as a result, after the release began, no one at the company could safely activate any of
the E-stops.a The only way that anyone at the company could safely shut off the flow of liquid nitrogen during
a
As discussed above, the two FFG maintenance workers may have had the opportunity to activate an E-stop and avert the release, but it
was impossible to determine whether the two workers were aware of the bent bubbler tube, whether they had sufficient knowledge and
training to understand what hazard the bent tube presented, or to what extent the workers were aware of the impending overflow.
59

Investigation Report
an uncontrolled release was by manually closing the bulk storage tank discharge valves, which were located
outside, and at the other end of, the building.
The CSB concludes that the placement of the Line 4 immersion-spiral freezer E-stop buttons required a
responding employee or person not otherwise in the freezer room to enter an oxygen-deficient atmosphere
during a release of liquid nitrogen to activate an E-stop. This design was unsafe. As a result, once FFG’s two
maintenance workers became incapacitated, the uncontrolled liquid nitrogen release could not be safely stopped
until employees manually closed valves at the bulk liquid nitrogen storage tanks outside of the building, or until
emergency responders equipped for entry into an oxygen-deficient atmosphere could enter the freezer room and
activate an E-stop. Safer placement of E-stop buttons, and effective employee training on their use, might have
helped prevent the death of some or all of the four employees who perished during emergency response.
4.3.5 INDUSTRY GUIDANCE FOR EMERGENCY SHUTOFF LOCATION
Various industry groups offer guidance on the proper design and location of emergency shutoff systems for use
with processes such as the one at FFG.
ISO 13850
ISO 13850 Safety of machinery – Emergency stop function – Principles for design is an international standard
published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Regarding the placement of E-stops, the
standard requires a risk assessment, and states:
An emergency stop device shall be located:
- At each operator control station, except where the risk assessment
indicates that this is not necessary;
- At other locations, as determined by the risk assessment, e.g.;
- At entrance and exit locations;
- At locations where intervention to the machinery is needed, e.g.
operations with a hold-to-run control function;
- At all places where a [human]/machine interaction is expected
by design.
Emergency stop devices shall be positioned so that they are directly accessible
and capable of non-hazardous actuation by the operator and others who could
need to actuate them [25, p. 7].
This guidance, though general, could potentially have reduced the severity of this incident had it been
implemented at the FFG facility.
60

Investigation Report
The CSB concludes that had FFG and Messer installed E-stop buttons outside the Line 4 freezer room, such as
at the entrances to the room or at the bulk storage tanks, the uncontrolled release could have been stopped more
expediently.
An example of such a design philosophy is shown below in Figure 21:
Figure 21. An example of potential additional safer E-stop placement. (Credit: CSB)
CGA P-76
CGA P-76 Hazards of Oxygen-Deficient Atmospheres explicitly identifies liquid nitrogen food freezers as an
example of equipment that can produce oxygen-deficient atmospheres [6, p. 5]. Section 6 of the standard
contains specific guidance on hazard mitigation and preventive measures for such systems. The standard states
that pipelines carrying inert gases “should be provided with a readily accessible isolation valve outside the
61

Investigation Report
building” [6, p. 7]. The standard states that such valves “Ideally […] should be remotely activated by push
buttons or other safety-monitoring equipment” [6, p. 7]. As discussed above, remotely operated emergency
isolation valves (ROEIVs) were installed on the liquid nitrogen supply piping to the FFG Line 4 liquid nitrogen
freezers, but the E-stop buttons to activate them were all located within the immediate vicinity of the freezers.
As currently written, CGA P-76 only recommends that equipment using inert gases should be equipped with
isolation valves, and only recommends that those valves ideally should be remotely activated. This guidance is
too permissive; as demonstrated by this incident and others (Table 4, Section 4.4.2.1), cryogenic asphyxiants
and inert gases can produce multiple-fatality incidents in the event of loss of containment. Further, the standard
contains no guidance on the proper location of remote activation devices (such as E-stop buttons). The CSB
recommends that the CGA update P-76 Hazards of Oxygen-Deficient Atmospheres. At a minimum, the updated
standard should:
a) Require that processes, equipment, and piping systems capable of producing oxygen-deficient
atmospheres shall be equipped with remotely operated emergency isolation valves (ROEIVs).
b) Include guidance on the adequate safe location of emergency stop devices. At a minimum this guidance
should be harmonized with the requirements of ISO 13850 Safety of machinery – Emergency stop
function – Principles for design. As necessary, augment the general guidance of ISO 13850 with
guidance specific to processes, equipment, and piping using cryogenic asphyxiants and inert gases.
In Section 4.2.3, the CSB recommended that the CGA develop a comprehensive liquid nitrogen standard
containing guidance on the use of atmospheric monitoring and alarm systems. The CSB also recommends that
that standard include requirements and guidance on the location of emergency shutdown devices such as E-
stops.
NFPA 55
NFPA 55 Compressed Gases and Cryogenic Fluids Code contains specific guidance on the use of bulk oxygen
systems, bulk liquefied hydrogen systems, bulk carbon dioxide systems, and liquid nitrous oxide systems,a but
not for liquid nitrogen systems. For cryogenic liquid systems other than those with specific guidance (those
listed above), NFPA 55 requires that the use of such systems comply with CGA P-18 Standard for Bulk Inert
Gas Systems (Section 4.2.2.5).b
For the use of all cryogenic fluids including liquid nitrogen, NFPA 55 requires that “accessible manual or
automatic emergency shutoff valves shall be provided”c and that such valves be located at the point of use, at the
tank or bulk source, and at the point where the system piping enters the building [22, p. 41].d The standard also
requires that “manual emergency shutoff valves or the device that activates an automatic emergency shutoff
valve […] shall be identified by means of a sign” [22, p. 41].e The phrase “devices that activate an automatic
emergency shutoff valve” applies to both manual emergency push buttons (E-stops) as well as atmospheric

monitoring devices interlocked to ROEIVs. However, the standard contains no guidance on the adequate
location of such devices. The CSB recommends to NFPA to update NFPA 55 Compressed Gases and Cryogenic
Fluids Code to include guidance on the adequate safe location of manual shutoff valves and devices such as
emergency push buttons used to activate remotely operated emergency isolation valves (ROEIVs). At a
minimum this guidance should be harmonized with the requirements of ISO 13850 Safety of machinery –
Emergency stop function – Principles for design.
IFC
The IFC requires that “shutoff valves shall be installed in piping containing cryogenic fluids where needed to
limit the volume of liquid discharged in the event of piping or equipment failure [21, pp. 55-4].”a The standard
does not specify whether shutoff valves should be manually or automatically actuated and offers no guidance on
the safe location of manual shutoff valves or devices used to remotely activate shutoff valves.
Therefore, the CSB recommends that the ICC update the IFC to include guidance on the adequate safe location
of manual shutoff valves and devices such as emergency push buttons used to activate remotely operated
emergency isolation valves (ROEIVs) in cryogenic fluid service. At a minimum this guidance should be
harmonized with the requirements of ISO 13850 Safety of machinery – Emergency stop function – Principles for
design.

Investigation Report
4.4 PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
OSHA and EPA do not define liquid nitrogen as a highly hazardous chemical or extremely hazardous substance,
and therefore neither OSHA’s Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard nor EPA’s Risk Management
Program (RMP) Rulea applies to liquid nitrogen processes, such as the Line 4 freezer process at FFG [26, 27].
Because of this, no regulation required FFG to implement process safety managementb practices for its liquid
nitrogen freezer process.
CCPS’s Guidelines for Risk Based Process Safety presents a broadly accepted framework for process safety
management consisting of 20 elements to help organizations design and implement more effective process
safety management systems [28, p. 2]. The CCPS developed the Risk Based Process Safety (RBPS) approach in
response to the stagnation and decline of process safety management system implementation that it perceived
within many organizations [28, p. 1]. The CCPS lists several possible causes of process safety management
performance stagnation, including:
• In the United States, process safety management has become synonymous with OSHA’s PSM
regulation, meaning organizations may fail to manage process safety when not required by regulation.
• Since worker injuries are much more frequent and are easier to measure, company resources
disproportionately focus on personal safety rather than process safety.
• Process safety management was developed by and for big companies. Small companies may believe
they do not have the capability to implement these systems [28, p. 2].
RBPS was intended as a framework that companies of any size and risk profile can adapt to their operations.
Regardless of the applicability of PSM regulatory requirements, RBPS was an applicable guideline available for
FFG to establish an effective process safety management system.
4.4.1 FFG’S INEFFECTIVE PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT
PRACTICES
FFG did not have an established process safety management program to identify and control the hazards of the
liquid nitrogen process. The following sections present key process safety management elements that, if FFG
had implemented, may have prevented the incident or mitigated its severity.c
a
In addition to nitrogen, anhydrous ammonia (a highly hazardous chemical/extremely hazardous substance) was present on the FFG site
at the time of the incident. However, FFG claimed that the ammonia within each process was below the threshold quantity that would
have required it to conform to the PSM standard and RMP rule. This report does not analyze FFG’s anhydrous ammonia processes,
except by noting that FFG did not have an established process safety management system.
b
This report distinguishes the terms “process safety management” (lower case) as the practices used to improve process safety and
“Process Safety Management (PSM)” to refer to OSHA’s PSM standard.
c
The CSB identified issues and missed opportunities with FFG’s safety practices related to many of the RBPS process safety
management elements. This report, however, will highlight only those elements that were causal or presented an opportunity to prevent
or mitigate the incident.
64

Investigation Report
4.4.1.1 Process Safety Culture and Leadership Responsibility
The RBPS element Process Safety Culture discusses how the combination of group values and behaviors
determines how process safety is managed [28, p. 40]. “The process safety culture of an organization is a
significant determinant of how it will approach process risk control issues, and process safety management
system failures can often be linked to cultural deficiencies” [28, p. 41]. The CCPS acknowledges that
management systems, policies, and procedures depend on individuals for their successful implementation [28, p.
42]. Accordingly, the CCPS provides the following guidance for ensuring an organization maintains an effective
process safety culture:
The leadership of an organization has the primary responsibility for identifying
the need for, and fostering, cultural change and for sustaining a sound culture
once it is established [28, p. 44].
Visible, active, and consistent support for process safety programs and objectives
exists at all levels of management within the organization. […] The concept of
process safety as a line responsibility is carried down through all levels of the
organization [28, p. 46].
The organization provides clear delegation of, and accountability for, safety-
related responsibilities. Accordingly, employees are provided the necessary
authority and resources to allow success in their assigned roles. Personnel accept
and fulfill their individual process safety responsibilities, and management
expects and encourages the sharing of process safety concerns by all members of
the organization [28, p. 47].
The organization places a high value on the training and development of
individuals and groups. […] The organization maintains a sufficient level of
expertise required for safe operations [28, p. 47].
Include in each manager’s job description explicit responsibilities that support
process safety culture initiatives […]. Provide accountabilities for successfully
carrying out these responsibilities [28, p. 59].
After Prime-Pak and Victory Processing formed the FFG joint venture in 2018, the safety responsibilities from
the two organizations were reorganized. FFG reassigned the EHS Manager from Victory Processing and the
Safety Coordinator from Prime-Pak into a new structure within the FFG Human Resources (HR) Department. In
addition, FFG discontinued the Safety Coordinator’s practice of performing regular safety walkthroughs of the

4.4.1.2 Process Hazard Analysis
The RBPS element Hazard Identification and Risk Analysis encompasses all activities involved in identifying
hazards and evaluating risk at a facility throughout the facility’s life cycle, to ensure that risks to workers, the
public, and the environment are consistently controlled. The analysis should assess and ask:
• Hazard – What can go wrong?

• Consequences – How bad could it be?
• Likelihood – How often might it happen [28, p. 210]? A PHA can only be effective

facility.,a The CSB concludes that FFG did not identify or evaluate
hazards specific to its process, such as the liquid nitrogen overflow and
asphyxiation risks, and did not implement effective controls to mitigate
the risk.
4.4.1.3 Procedures
The RBPS element Operating Procedures states that organizations should develop “written instructions that (1)
list the steps for a given task and (2) describe the way the steps are to be performed. Good procedures describe
the process, hazards, tools, protective equipment, and controls in enough detail that operators understand the
hazards, can verify that controls are in place, and can confirm that the process responds in an expected manner”
[28, pp. 245-246].
FFG did not develop written procedures for the operation or maintenance of the liquid nitrogen freezer. In
addition, Messer did not provide FFG with any operating manuals for the freezer equipment prior to the

incident.a FFG relied on verbal communications with Messer for information on operating the freezer. As the
FFG Plant 4 Maintenance Manager described:
The freezer for Line 4 and the [immersion] freezer, we did not have any
documents or any type of books yet […] Usually I’m used to, any time a new
machine comes in, I get a box full of manuals and all kinds of stuff. […] And,
honestly, I wasn’t really too concerned about the book right now because I had
[the Messer Sales Engineer] here. He was my book…
There was insufficient evidence to determine how the bubbler tube was bent. One of the hypotheses the CSB
considered and tested was intentional or unintentional human manipulation of the bubbler tube. Although the
CSB could not determine whether anyone manipulated the tube, proper maintenance procedures and training
could have better informed employees about safety-critical devices, which might have prevented the release.
The CSB concludes that FFG did not have written procedures to operate or maintain the liquid nitrogen freezer,
and therefore the FFG employees were not provided with clear instructions and precautions in operating the
equipment. Had FFG developed clear written procedures, it is likely that the FFG workers would have
understood the function of the freezer, the importance of critical components, and proper precautions when
operating and troubleshooting the equipment, which may have prevented the release.
4.4.1.4 Management of Change
The RBPS element Management of Change ensures that changes to a process do not inadvertently introduce
new hazards or increase the risk of existing hazards [28, p. 424]. A proper management of change program will
recognize change situations, evaluate hazards associated with the change, decide whether to allow the change to
be made, and complete necessary risk control measures [28, p. 423]. According to CCPS, organizations should
establish and implement procedures to manage changes that address:
• the technical basis for the proposed change;
• impact of the proposed change on safety and health; and
• authorization requirements for the proposed change [28, p. 435].
Change from Ammonia to Liquid Nitrogen Freezers
As discussed in Section 1.2, FFG installed the liquid nitrogen immersion-spiral freezer in 2020 to expand the
capabilities and increase efficiency of the Line 4 product line. The new freezer system could be utilized as an
alternative to the previously used ammonia spiral freezer in the adjacent room. To support product flow, FFG
selected the Lower Dry Storage Room, a storage space recessed from some of the surrounding rooms, and
without mechanical ventilation (shown in Figure 23), to house the new liquid nitrogen freezer equipment.
a
In a post-incident civil lawsuit deposition, a Messer employee stated that not only did Messer not provide the manuals to FFG, but that
the manuals weren’t fully written yet and were still being updated to reflect the customizations made to the FFG Line 4 freezers even
after the freezers had begun operation.
68

Investigation Report
Figure 23. The former Lower Dry Storage room was selected to house the Line 4 liquid nitrogen freezer
equipment. (Credit: FFG, annotations by CSB)
FFG modified the Lower Dry Storage room by adding walls to separate the immersion-spiral freezer from the
adjacent areas of the plant and constructed a clean room opposite the equipment., Other than the installation of
the liquid nitrogen freezer equipment, FFG made no other major modifications to the Lower Dry Storage area.
FFG did not have an established management of change process and did not consider how changes to the
process, building, and equipment could impact process safety.
Review and Approval of Changes
FFG completed a Capital Expenditure Request in 2020 to manage and approve the building modifications
required for the liquid nitrogen freezer transition. The request included a description of the necessary building
and equipment modifications, a project justification that considered impacts to production and efficiency, and
approvals by the Senior Vice President of Operations, Senior Vice President of Sales, Chief Financial Officer,
and Chief Executive Officer (CEO).a The Capital Expenditure Request was not approved by anyone with
explicit responsibility for safety, however, and the Safety Manager role was vacant until December 2020. The
request did not include a technical basis for the change and did not consider process safety.
Failure to Consider Equipment Location Risks
The Dry Product Storage room, where the liquid nitrogen freezer was ultimately installed, was recessed roughly
five feet from the floor of two of the surrounding rooms, as shown in Figure 24 and discussed in Section 1.4.
a
A similar process was used to approve Line 2 modifications. In 2019, FFG completed a Capital Expenditure Request to install a new
liquid nitrogen spiral freezer on Line 2, which included the same review and approval authorities as the 2020 Line 4 request.
69

Investigation Report
Figure 24. Immersion freezer room recessed nearly five feet from two adjacent rooms. (Credit: CSB)
The only openings in the freezer room at the same level as the floor were the standard-sized door leading to the
clean room and the large doorway leading to the warehouse and loading dock (which was partially enclosed by a
heavy plastic strip curtain). The other two openings in the room were both elevated roughly five feet above the
floor of the room.
Ultimately, between the floor and roughly five feet of elevation, two of the walls in the freezer room were fully
enclosed, one was nearly fully enclosed (containing only a standard-sized door for personnel entry and exit), and
the fourth had a large doorway that was partially enclosed by heavy plastic strip curtains (which partially
restricted airflow through the door). As a result, the portion of the room most susceptible to oxygen
deficiency—the lower portions of the room, since cold nitrogen vapors are heavier than air—was nearly fully
enclosed, and thus was easily capable of retaining a large volume of cold, vaporized nitrogen.
CGA P-76 Hazards of Oxygen-Deficient Atmospheres provides guidance on controlling asphyxiation hazards
when handling cryogenic liquids:
Poorly ventilated areas, […] enclosures, and low-grade areas can contain
oxygen-deficient atmospheres. […] An oxygen-deficient atmosphere can bring
about unconsciousness without warning. In as little as one or two breaths, an
individual’s life can be endangered by low oxygen intake [6, p. 4].
70

Investigation Report
In processes where cryogenic liquids are handled and vaporization takes place,
care shall be taken to avoid situations where personnel are exposed to oxygen
deficiency. Examples of such spaces include […] rooms where liquid nitrogen
food freezers are operated […] [6, p. 5].
CGA P-76 provides additional guidance on required ventilation within enclosed spaces:
Examples of enclosures include […] rooms where inert cryogenic liquid is used
or stored. Building/room size, ventilation capacity, and system pressures shall be
determined for each specific case. The following control measures may be
applied to ventilation system design:
• Continuous ventilation while the hazard exists. This can be achieved by
interlocking the ventilation system with the process power supply;
• Adequate air flow around the normal operating areas;
• Minimum ventilation capacity of 6 air changes per hour [6, p. 8].
The Dry Product Storage room was not equipped with HVAC or mechanical ventilation, and FFG did not install
ventilation after the installation of the liquid nitrogen freezer. As the Plant 4 FFG Maintenance Manager
described:
There’s not an HVAC system in that room. We open the wall from our oven room
area to allow air to flow […] through our makeup air system.
The CSB concludes that FFG did not have a management of change process to identify, assess, and manage risk
introduced by process changes. During the introduction of the liquid nitrogen immersion-spiral freezer, FFG did
not consider how the change could impact process safety, did not include approval authorities with explicit
responsibilities for safety, and did not address conformance with industry guidance. As a result, FFG did not
manage the risks associated with using a mostly enclosed, partially recessed room without mechanical
ventilation and installed the liquid nitrogen freezer in an area particularly susceptible to an oxygen-deficient
atmosphere.
4.4.1.5 Training, Hazard Awareness, and Communication
The RBPS element Training and Performance Assurance describes practical instruction in job requirements and
methods to enable workers to meet performance standards and maintain proficiency [28, p. 396]. According to
CCPS:
• A set of training materials should be developed for each training need [28, p. 397].
• A training record should be provided for each worker showing that person’s training needs, the dates on
which initial training and any refresher training was satisfactorily completed, and a schedule of future
training classes [28, p. 397].
71

Investigation Report
• An appropriate approach for verifying performance should be documented [28, p. 397].
• Examiners should be provided with the resources necessary to test workers [28, p. 397].
• In addition to the specific task training, the training program should provide workers with an overview
of the process and an understanding of its hazards [28, p. 402].
In addition, the RBPS element Workforce Involvement states that “workers, at all levels and in all positions in an
organization, should have roles and responsibilities for enhancing and ensuring the safety of the organization’s
operations” [28, p. 124]. An effective process safety management system “provides workers the information
necessary to understand the hazards to which they may be exposed” [28, p. 126] and “requires the active
involvement of workers who (1) are aware of the hazards in the workplace, (2) understand the engineered
controls and management systems provided to address those hazards, and (3) accept and strive to fulfill their
roles and responsibilities in support of providing a safe work environment” [28, p. 128].
Furthermore, CGA P-76 Hazards of Oxygen Deficient Atmospheres states that individuals who handle or use
inert gases shall be trained and informed of safety measures, hazards of release, and the potential for oxygen
depletion [6, p. 6].
4.4.1.6 Lack of Training

Process safety leadership responsibility means company executives have ultimate responsibility to ensure risks are properly managed.
Following the Macondo blowout and explosion, the CSB issued the CSB Best Practice Guidance for Corporate Boards of Directors

high-hazard industry, […] its […] executives should ensure that there are effective safety management systems in place to properly
manage risks with the goal of preventing major accidents and protecting workers, the public, and the environment. Implementing a
robust process safety program is important to a company’s overall success.” [56]. Given the potential for catastrophic consequences,
these principles apply to executives whose companies handle and process cryogenic asphyxiants just as they apply to the oil and gas
industry.

presence in FFG
Plant 4
The CSB concludes that FFG had no system, plan, or program to train and verify the competency of its
employees when operating the liquid nitrogen freezer and working with or near hazardous liquid nitrogen. As a
result, FFG employees at all levels of the organization were not aware of the hazards of liquid nitrogen and were
unaware of precautions that should have been taken.
4.4.1.7 Lack of Hazard Communication
CGA P-76 Hazards of Oxygen-Deficient Atmospheres specifies that, along with a proper training program
discussed above, areas with potential asphyxiation hazards shall be identified or have restricted access. CGA
provides an example of a warning sign used to communicate the risk of asphyxiation hazards (Figure 25).
Figure 25. Example of a warning sign for asphyxiation hazard [6, p. 7]. (Credit: CGA)
Neither FFG nor Messer provided such warning signage for the asphyxiation hazard in the Line 4 freezer room,
as shown in Figure 26. By not restricting entrance to the freezer room or providing adequate warning signage,
workers were able to enter the freezer room unaware of the potential asphyxiation hazards.
74

Investigation Report
Figure 26. Lack of warning signs for the presence of liquid nitrogen and asphyxiation hazard at the entrance to
the freezer room from the loading dock (left) and clean room (right). (Credit: CSB and Messer)
In addition, the freezer equipment included no signage warning of the risks of liquid nitrogen. OSHA’s Hazard
Communication (HazCom) standard requires employers to label containers of hazardous chemicals with words,
pictures, and/or symbols to provide information regarding hazards.a As part of the equipment installation,
Messer provided liquid nitrogen warning labels (with both English and Spanish text) to be affixed to the freezer
equipment, as shown in Figure 27. However, these labels were stored within a folder inside the freezer HMI and
were never affixed to the freezer. Neither FFG nor Messer applied the labels to the equipment prior to the
incident, and thus the information was not properly displaced to workers.

risks within the room.

4.4.2 LACK OF REGULATIONS FOR CRYOGENIC ASPHYXIANTS
As discussed in Section 4.4, the FFG liquid nitrogen freezer process was not subject to OSHA’s PSM standard
(or EPA’s RMP rule). In addition, there is no existing regulation that requires organizations that handle or
process cryogenic asphyxiants to adhere to the requirements of CGA, CCPS, or any safe handling and safety
management system guidelines.
4.4.2.1 Fatalities from Liquid Nitrogen Release Incidents
By OSHA’s definition, a highly hazardous chemical is “a substance possessing toxic, reactive, flammable, or
explosive properties” [26].a Since liquid nitrogen is not toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive, it does not meet
OSHA’s definition of a highly hazardous chemical.b Regardless, uncontrolled liquid nitrogen releases have
resulted in serious injuries and fatalities in several industries. Since 2008, the CSB is aware of at least seven
incidents involving liquid nitrogen that have resulted in 13 fatalities in the United States, as shown in Table 4.
None of these incidents were subject to a regulated process safety management standard for liquid nitrogen.

4.4.2.2 Existing Regulations and Guidance
OSHA’s stated mission is to “ensure safe and healthful working conditions for workers by setting and enforcing
standards and by providing training, outreach, education and assistance” [29]. Since OSHA’s standards cover
FFG and its workers, the violations cited by OSHA at the FFG facility prior to and following the January 2021
incident provide insight into the scope of applicable existing regulations.
OSHA Citations Prior to the FFG Incident
Between 2016 and 2020, OSHA inspected the FFG facility three times, as shown in Table 5. While OSHA
found several violations, OSHA did not document any findings or concerns relating to FFG’s handling of liquid
nitrogen during these visits.

violations related to walking-working surfaces, stairs, exit routes, PPE, confined space, control of hazardous
energy, first aid, HazCom, and the General Duty Clause. None related directly to FFG’s handling of liquid

Investigation Report
Since there is no specific OSHA standard governing the use of liquid nitrogen, there is a serious gap in
regulations that address preventative and mitigative measures to safely handle liquid nitrogen and other
cryogenic asphyxiants. As discussed below, there are several regulations that applied to FFG and apply to other
users of liquid nitrogen. None of the existing regulations would have prevented the accidental release, however.
Hazard Communication (29 CFR 1910.1200)
OSHA’s HazCom standard found in 29 CFR 1910.1200 is intended to “ensure that the hazards of all chemicals
produced […] are classified, and that information concerning the classified hazards is transmitted to employers
and employees” [30].a The standard “requires chemical manufacturers […] to classify the hazards of chemicals
which they produce […], and all employers to provide information to their employees about the hazardous
chemicals to which they are exposed, by means of a hazard communication program, labels and other forms of
warning, safety data sheets, and information and training” [30].b
As discussed in Section 4.4.1.5, had FFG better informed its workforce about the presence and hazards of liquid
nitrogen, its workers may not have decided to enter the freezer room to attempt to rescue their coworkers. This
could have reduced the severity of the incident by preventing some or all of the additional four employee deaths
and three serious injuries. More effective hazard communication likely would not have prevented the accidental
release.
Control of Hazardous Energy (29 CFR 1910.147)
OSHA’s Control of Hazardous Energy (Lockout/Tagout) standard found in 29 CFR 1910.147 “covers the
servicing and maintenance of machines and equipment in which the unexpected energization or start up of the
machines or equipment, or release of stored energy could cause injury to employees” [31].c The standard
“requires employers to establish a program and utilize procedures for affixing appropriate lockout devices or
tagout devices to energy isolating devices, and to otherwise disable machines or equipment to prevent
unexpected energization, start-up or release of stored energy in order to prevent injury to employees” [31].d
Since this incident involved the failure of a safety-critical level control device during active troubleshooting
activities, proper energy isolation activities may have impacted the outcome of this incident. As discussed in
Section 2.2.1, two FFG workers were attempting to troubleshoot the liquid nitrogen flow without turning off the
freezer or isolating the flow of liquid nitrogen when the release began. However, even if the flow of nitrogen
had been isolated during the troubleshooting, at some point the workers likely would have unlocked and re-
engaged the flow, likely resulting in the same outcome. Isolating the nitrogen flow likely would not have
prevented the damage to the bubbler tube. As identified in OSHA’s investigation, FFG did not adhere to many
of the requirements of the Control of Hazardous Energy standard.e However, in this particular incident, the
Control of Hazardous Energy standard would not have prevented the release or the subsequent fatalities.

Investigation Report
General Duty Clause (Section 5(a)(1))
The Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act of 1970, Section 5(a)(1), also known as the General Duty
Clause, requires employers to “furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which
are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his
employees” [32]. While the General Duty Clause requires employers to ensure that the workplace is free from
recognized hazards, it is a reactive regulation that OSHA relies upon to cite employers for hazards that are not
explicitly covered in other regulations. The General Duty Clause contains no guidance on how to prevent
incidents.
HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120)
OSHA’s HAZWOPER standard found in 29 CFR 1910.120 applies to “emergency response operations for
releases of, or substantial threats of releases of, hazardous substances without regard to the location of the
hazard,” among other subjects [33].a The standard requires that employers develop an ERP that addresses
“emergency recognition and prevention” [33].b The standard regulates response to an incident that has already
occurred and does not prevent incidents in the first place. Additionally, the standard simply requires employers
to develop a plan that “addresses” prevention, with no specific guidance or requirements on how to do so.
In general, the HAZWOPER standard seeks to prevent untrained employees from responding to an incident. The
regulation requires employers to either develop an EAP (in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.38) that requires and
trains all employees to evacuate all emergencies, or to develop an ERP (in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.120)
that requires that employees designated for response activities be properly trained and equipped for response. In
either case, employees who are not trained to respond must not respond. In the FFG incident, numerous
untrained people responded to the liquid nitrogen release by entering the Line 4 freezer room or rooms adjacent
to it. Nevertheless, OSHA did not cite FFG for violating the HAZWOPER standard or for violating the EAP
requirements of 29 CFR 1910.38. As noted in Section 4.3, FFG had an EAP purportedly intended for
compliance with 29 CFR 1910.38, meaning that at the policy level, FFG elected not to respond to any
emergencies and instead evacuate. However, among the people who responded were management officials who
would have been responsible for implementing FFG’s asserted policy of evacuation without response.
Other Regulations Cited by OSHA
Many of the OSHA-cited violations issued in response to the Line 4 incident were not relevant to the liquid
nitrogen release, as discussed below:
• Confined Space (29 CFR 1910.146) – The incident did not involve confined space entry.
• Exit Routes (29 CFR 1910.36-37) – Given the nature of the release, the egress path available to the
workers likely did not contribute to this incident.

Investigation Report
• First Aid (29 CFR 1910.151)a – The availability of an eye wash station or safety shower is irrelevant to
this incident.
• PPE (29 CFR 1910.132) – The availability of differing PPE for workers would not have prevented the
accidental release, although it could have lessened the severity of the incident had responding workers
been equipped with personal oxygen monitors or equipment suitable for entry into an oxygen-deficient
atmosphere.
• Stairs (29 CFR 1910.25) – The condition of stairs is irrelevant to this incident.
• Walking-Working Surfaces (29 CFR 1910.22) – The condition of walking surfaces is irrelevant to this
incident.
OSHA’s Recommended Practices for Safety and Health Programs
In response to other similar liquid nitrogen asphyxiation incidents,b OSHA has urged employers to follow
OSHA’s Recommended Practices for Safety and Health Programs, a voluntary resource that includes
Management Leadership, Hazard Identification and Assessment, Hazard Prevention and Control, and Education
and Training [34, 35]. However, OSHA’s Recommended Practices for Safety and Health Programs are not
enforceable.
4.4.2.3 Emphasis Programs
According to OSHA,
Local Emphasis Programs (LEPs) are enforcement strategies designed and
implemented at the regional office and/or area office levels. These programs are
intended to address hazards or industries that pose a particular risk to workers in
the office’s jurisdiction. The emphasis programs may be implemented by a single
area office, or at the regional level (Regional Emphasis Programs [REPs]), and
applied to all of the area offices within the region. These LEPs will be
accompanied by outreach intended to make employers in the area aware of the
program as well as the hazards that the programs are designed to reduce or
eliminate [36].
Currently, there are three REPs covering the meat and poultry processing industry; Region 4 [37] (covering
Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee), Region 5
[38] (covering Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin), and Region 6 [39] (covering
Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas). The Region 4 REP became effective on April 1,

In response to the November 2019 asphyxiation fatality caused by a release of liquid nitrogen at the Custom Genetic Solutions LLC in
Mitchell, South Dakota, OSHA issued a press release that states: “OSHA’s Recommended Practices for Safety and Health Programs
provides employers with a plan for managing safety and health within their workplaces, including hazard identification and assessment,
hazard prevention and control, and education and training.” [34]

2022 (after the incident at FFG), and the Regions 5 and 6 REPs became effective on October 1, 2023. The REPs
cover the elements shown in Table 6 below.

Among the “other hazards” included in the Region 4 REP, OSHA inspectors are directed to “identify and
evaluate potential chemical or physical hazards including carbon dioxide [and]…non-PSM refrigerant
chemical[s] [37, p. 15].” Likewise, the Region 5 REP includes “refrigeration chemicals (e.g., carbon dioxide,
ammonia) [38, p. 27].” Liquid nitrogen is not specifically mentioned in any of the REPs.
Applicability of Liquid Nitrogen within Current REPs
Emphasis programs are an important tool for OSHA to proactively inspect facilities for common hazards prior to
an incident occurring. They also generate data for potential future rulemaking actions. OSHA currently has three
active REPs that cover the meat and poultry processing industries. None of the existing REPs specifically
mention liquid nitrogen, although the Regions 4 and 5 REPs cover “non-PSM refrigerant” chemicals and
“refrigeration chemicals,” respectively.
It is unclear whether the Region 4 REP (which covers the state of Georgia, where the FFG incident occurred)
would have applied to FFG’s liquid nitrogen processes had it been in effect prior to the incident. Its application
depends on OSHA’s interpretation of the word “refrigerant.” The Region 6 REP covers PSM-regulated
83

Investigation Report
chemicals such as ammonia freezing and refrigeration processes or chlorine used for water treatment processes
but lacks the same provision for non-PSM substances that the Region 4 REP contains. Therefore, the CSB
recommends that OSHA:
• Update the Region 4 Poultry Processing Facilities Regional Emphasis Program to explicitly cover liquid
nitrogen freezing processes. At a minimum, the update should encourage practices applicable to
managing the hazards of using liquid nitrogen and other cryogenic asphyxiants, including process safety
management practices, atmospheric monitoring, employee training and hazard awareness, and
emergency preparedness and response;
• Update the Region 5 Regional Emphasis Program for Food Manufacturing Industry to explicitly cover
liquid nitrogen freezing processes. At a minimum, the update should encourage practices applicable to
managing the hazards of using liquid nitrogen and other cryogenic asphyxiants, including process safety
management practices, atmospheric monitoring, employee training and hazard awareness, and
emergency preparedness and response; and,
• Update the Region 6 Poultry Processing Facilities Regional Emphasis Program to explicitly cover liquid
nitrogen freezing processes. At a minimum, the update should encourage practices applicable to
managing the hazards of using liquid nitrogen and other cryogenic asphyxiants, including process safety
management practices, atmospheric monitoring, employee training and hazard awareness, and
emergency preparedness and response.
4.4.2.4 Conclusions
As discussed throughout this report, there is abundant industry guidance concerning the proper handling and
safety management of cryogenic asphyxiants and cryogenic systems. CCPS provides guidance on the design of
instrumented systems (Section 4.1), the execution of PHAs (Section 4.1), the use of atmospheric monitoring
(Section 4.2.2.2), and the implementation of a process safety management system (Section 4.4). CGA requires
the use of atmospheric monitoring (Section 4.2.2.3), provides guidance on isolation valve placement and design
(Section 4.3.5), presents facility design considerations (4.4.1.4), requires proper hazard communication and
training (Section 4.4.1.5), and provides guidelines for process safety management systems (Section 4.5.2).
NFPA requires the use of atmospheric monitoring (Section 4.2.2.5) and the installation of emergency isolation
valves (Section 4.3.5).
Despite the plethora of industry guidance, none of these requirements and guidelines are currently enforceable
by regulation.

Investigation Report
4.5 PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP
The owner/operator of a hazardous process has the ultimate responsibility for the safety of its processes, facility,
and people who work at its facility. In situations like FFG, where the owner and operator of a process are two
different companies (FFG operated the equipment, but Messer owned it), responsibility for safety should be
shared. Despite FFG’s poor safety practices, Messer had the expertise, ability, and opportunity to take effective
action to prevent this incident or reduce its likelihood or severity.
Product stewardship refers to the management practice supporting a philosophy of service to customers and
minimizing effects on health and the environment throughout the complete life cycle of a product [40].
The American Chemistry Council (ACC), a trade organization that represents chemical companies in the United
States, provides product stewardship guidelines through its Responsible Care® program [41, 42]. According to
the ACC, Responsible Care® companies are committed to a culture of continual improvement in product safety
and product stewardship for each stage of a product’s life cycle. As part of this, the ACC developed the Product
Safety Code, which provides a set of practices to manage chemical product safety and enhance it as part of its
industry’s health, safety, security, and environmental management system. The Product Safety Code requires
that companies include product safety and product stewardship as part of their management systems. According
to the ACC, product safety includes exchanging information regarding product hazards, intended uses, handling
practices, exposures, and risks. The ACC describes product stewardship as the responsibility to understand,
manage, and communicate the health and environmental impacts throughout the life cycle of chemical products.
The customers of member companies and users of the members’ products are an important focus of product
stewardship [43, 44].
4.5.1 MESSER’S PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP PRACTICES
Messer is a member of the ACC’s Responsible Care® program and has stated its commitment to the Responsible
Care® Guiding Principles “to work with customers, carriers, suppliers, distributors and contractors to foster the
safe and secure use, transport and disposal of chemicals and provide hazard and risk information that can be
accessed and applied in their operations and products” [45]. However, in a statement to the CSB, Messer
clarified that its food freezer business had not been audited and certified under its Responsible Care® program,
stating:
Currently, the Food Freezer Market business is not part of the Responsible Care
Certification Program. The Food Freezer Markets business is scheduled for
inclusion into the certification program beginning in year 2024 […]. As it relates
to Messer-installed equipment at FFG, only the bulk liquid nitrogen storage tanks
were developed using the Responsible Care Management System Guidelines.
Regardless, as part of the Line 4 liquid nitrogen freezer startup effort, Messer completed a product stewardship
checklist with FFG employees, with the stated purpose to “document the suggested customer interface training
and submittals to [e]nsure Messer is providing good safe customer stewardship of our products and services.”
However, while specific items in the checklist were marked as complete, FFG never signed the checklist
86

Investigation Report
acknowledging completion of the items. Furthermore, the CSB found inconsistencies between items marked
complete by Messer and actual implementation, as shown in Table 7.
Table 7. Messer Responsible Care checklist items.

(Section 4.2.1)
Former Practices
Prior to the Messer’s acquisition of Linde’s liquid nitrogen freezer business (see Section 1.1.2), Linde provided
customers with a detailed awareness training presentation on the hazards of oxygen deficiency and asphyxiation
when handling nitrogen. This training included a list of several minimum requirements and key
recommendations for customers, including ensuring that:
• safety information sheets are kept as a record by the customer;
• the customer is aware of safety documentation from gas industry associations, such as CGA;
87

Investigation Report
• information on relevant safety services is available locally to safeguard against asphyxiation;
• gas analyzers are in the correct location, are calibrated, and function;
• ventilation systems are operational and effective; and
• adequate warning signs are in place.
Linde stated that its “Duty of Care” to customers was to:
…provide a good design and installation of equipment [and] take appropriate
action if unsafe use of Linde products becomes apparent (i.e. being a responsible
supplier). […] In high risk [situations, Linde] will have to consider terminating
supply. (emphasis added)
After Messer’s acquisition of Linde’s liquid nitrogen freezer business, Messer did not continue Linde’s “Duty of
Care” practices.
4.5.2 INEFFECTIVE PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP
Prior to and following the startup of the liquid nitrogen freezer system, Messer was aware of FFG’s poor safety
practices. Nevertheless, Messer continued to supply FFG with liquid nitrogen despite FFG’s failure to correct
the issues. Examples of Messer’s inadequate product stewardship are presented below.
Commitment to Process Safety
The CGA is a trade association that develops safety standards and safe practice guidelines for the industrial,
medical, food, and specialty compressed and liquefied gases industries [46]. The CGA’s standards and
guidelines are applicable to liquid nitrogen freezers, such as the one Messer leased to FFG. Messer is a CGA
member company and is therefore aware of the CGA’s standards and their applicability.
CGA P-86, Guideline for Process Safety Management presents 21 process safety management elements in its
process safety framework, as shown in Table 8 [47, pp. 3-4].

According to the CGA, “The process safety management framework may be applied to all processes within the
industrial […] gases industry. It is designed to address process safety hazards and be equally suitable for the
processes that are found in the industry including […] customer installations.” (emphasis added) [47, p. 1].
CGA P-86 Element 5, Communication with stakeholders, states:
In relation to major hazards, management shall identify key stakeholder groups
and develop and maintain a good working relationship […], understanding and
addressing their issues and concerns. […] External stakeholders may include […]
customers. (emphasis added) [47, p. 7].
Appropriate safety information is shared with stakeholders to demonstrate the
organization’s commitment to process safety. (emphasis added) [47, p. 7].
CGA P-86 Element 6, Hazard identification and risk assessment, states:
[Organizations] should ensure that a comprehensive risk assessment process
systematically identifies, assesses, and provides mitigations for the risks arising
from […] operations [47, p. 7].
Risk assessments consider process safety risk as well as risk to […] asset
integrity, […] and customers. (emphasis added) [47, p. 8].
Identified stakeholders are kept informed about the risk assessment process and
results [47, p. 8].
As discussed in Section 4.4.1, FFG did not have an established process safety management system and lacked
many important process safety management practices. FFG further lacked the institutional knowledge and
experience required to implement such practices. Conversely, industrial gas suppliers like Messer have
extensive expertise with and knowledge of the process safety risks posed by the materials and equipment they
provide to their customers.
89

Investigation Report
While the owner or operator of a facility has the ultimate responsibility to implement effective practices and
safeguards to manage process safety risks and to protect its workers, industrial gas suppliers are often more
knowledgeable of the hazards of their products and equipment than their customers, as was the case with Messer
and FFG. Thus, companies like Messer should work with their customers to ensure effective process safety
management practices are utilized, particularly when the knowledge base and experience required to do so may
not be present at the customer level.
Awareness of the Absence of Atmospheric Monitoring
During a site visit to a separate Plant 4 production linea in August 2020, Messer recognized that FFG did not
have proper atmospheric monitoring based on the hazards posed by the cryogenic liquids being handled. In
response, the Messer Sales Engineer sent an email to the FFG Senior Vice President of Operations stating:
[Messer] highly recommend[s] the use of permanently mounted [o]xygen and
[carbon dioxide] monitors augmented with the use of personal/portable monitors
as part of the plant’s safety system.
Along with this notification in August 2020, Messer provided FFG with information on Messer’s Responsible
Care initiative and information on how to obtain atmospheric monitors, as shown in Figure 29.
Figure 29. Excerpt from Messer’s notification to FFG on the need for atmospheric monitoring. (Credit: Messer)
As discussed in Section 4.2.1, FFG continued to operate the freezer without atmospheric monitoring at the time
of the incident.
Awareness of No Mechanical Ventilation and Risks Presented by Freezer Location
As discussed in Section 4.4.1.4, the FFG Line 4 freezer room was not equipped with either HVAC or industrial
ventilation. During the freezer installation, Messer was aware of the lack of mechanical ventilation in the room
FFG selected to install the freezer equipment. The exhaust system installed on the freezer equipment required a
a

90

Investigation Report
supply of fresh air to replenish air removed from the exhaust system, called make-up air. Contractually, Messer
provided the make-up air volume calculation to FFG, and FFG was responsible for ensuring the ventilation
requirements were met. In a post-incident interview with the CSB, the Messer Project Manager conveyed
concerns about the lack of ventilation and insufficient make-up air in the freezer room:
Usually, customers have massive make-up air units in their room, so when you
add [the freezer] in there, it doesn’t matter. You’re still going to get the
circulation. Some of them actually have to add blowers to the make-up air units
to basically compensate for what we’re taking out.
[In the Line 4 freezer room], I didn’t see any make-up air, what we call forced
circulation.
The Messer Project Manager added:
[Messer doesn’t] do a whole HVAC calculation and assess the actual size of the
room and calculate what’s going on. We just know that this freezer’s [exhaust is]
pulling this amount of air from the room, and if you want to maintain the integrity
of that room, just make sure you can replace that same, make sure that same
supply is in there.
As discussed in Section 4.4.1.4, FFG relied on the opening from the adjacent processing room to supply make-
up air. This method of supplying make-up air is unreliable, as described by the Messer Project Manager:
With the […] opening, that’s natural circulation. So we don’t count on natural
circulation as flow because that can vary and it’s very hard to measure. We count
on forced circulation. So that means you put a certain make-up air unit in there.
You know what it is. You can count on it. And it’s shooting in the space, and it’s
doing its job.
Following a site visit elsewhere in the facility in August 2020, the Messer Sales Engineer sent an email to the
FFG Senior Vice President of Operations conveying concerns about FFG’s general ventilation design:
Messer would like to emphasize the need for adequate ventilation/exhaust
systems to ensure the plant atmosphere contains levels of [carbon dioxide] and
[nitrogen] below exposure limits and oxygen levels are above 19.5%.
FFG did not address the ventilation concerns. As discussed in Sections 4.4.1.4 and 4.2.1, FFG continued to
operate the freezer without mechanical room ventilation and atmospheric monitoring and alarm systems.
Messer also would have been aware that the room was mostly enclosed above five feet of elevation and nearly
fully enclosed below five feet of elevation. Despite the inherent risks of the Line 4 freezer room, Messer did not
object to FFG’s placement of the freezer, either in the proposal stage or the construction stage, and Messer
91

Investigation Report
continued to supply FFG with liquid nitrogen. Messer was leasing the freezer to FFG and could have objected to
the placement of the freezer, suspended liquid nitrogen supply, or terminateda the agreement.
Awareness of Defeated Interlocks
On January 26, 2021, two days prior to the incident, the Messer Sales Engineer was observing the Line 4
immersion-spiral freezer when he discovered that an interlocked freezer door was open while the freezer was
operating, a condition that normally would automatically shut down nitrogen flow to the freezer. According to
the Messer Sales Engineer, when the door and lid safety are properly installed, it is not possible to open the door
during operations under normal conditions:
Those doors have to be shut in order for the freezer to operate. So they’re all
sealed during operation. If you open those doors, those magnetic switches will
alarm and shut off everything and ramp up the exhaust to full speed.
Upon discovering this situation, the Messer Sales Engineer verbally informed the FFG Maintenance Manager
that the inoperable interlock posed a safety hazard and needed to be repaired:
Well, initially the machine was in a shutdown mode so the machine was not
actually running, and so I had no response to the transition door being open under
those conditions. But once they started running the machine and I noticed that
the transition box door was still open, I recognized that that is not a condition
that is acceptable. And I told [the FFG Maintenance Manager] and the
maintenance guy that that is an unsafe condition and that it needed to be repaired.
During the investigation, the CSB determined that the transition box door and freezer lid safety switches had
been tampered with such that they were defeated, as shown in Figure 30. In the as-found condition, the system
would recognize the door and lid as closed, regardless of their actual positions, allowing the door or lid to be
opened to access the freezer interior even when the freezer was operational. As the Messer Sales Engineer told
the CSB:
That magnet has been removed from the door and taped to the switch. Somebody
has removed the magnet from the door and taped it to the switch so they can open
the door while the freezer’s running.
a
Since Messer owned the immersion-spiral freezer, FFG contractually would not be able to replace Messer with a different liquid
nitrogen supplier without also replacing the equipment.
92

Investigation Report

Prior to the incident, the Messer Sales Engineer did not report this condition to anyone at Messer, purportedly
because he was told by FFG’s maintenance personnel that the switches would be restored to their proper
positions. Nevertheless, FFG had not repaired the defeated interlocked door switches prior to the incident.
The CSB concludes that Messer did not practice effective product stewardship prior to the incident. Messer was
aware of several instances of FFG’s process safety deficiencies and poor safety practices yet still commissioned
the freezer to FFG. Using more effective product stewardship, Messer could have prevented this incident by 1)
objecting to the placement of the freezer in a room particularly susceptible to oxygen deficiency, 2) refusing to
commission its freezer equipment until FFG provided adequate atmospheric monitoring and alarm systems, 3)
suspending supply of liquid nitrogen until safety deficiencies had been addressed, or 4) ending the relationship
with FFG and removing its equipment.
4.5.3 MESSER POST-INCIDENT ACTIONS
Following the incident, Messer has implemented a new product stewardship safety program, which includes a
safety assessment process for freezer equipment and associated supply piping at Messer customer sites,
applicable to sites where Messer supplies liquid nitrogen and liquid carbon dioxide. As part of the program,
Messer will perform safety inspections when engaging in new business or additional use for new food freezer
applications, at customer request, or when a Messer employee notes a concern. Additionally, Messer will
perform a safety inspection for all existing food freezing customers. The safety inspections will include reviews
of:
• atmospheric conditions;
• atmospheric monitoring interlocked into cryogenic liquid supply;
• exhaust systems;
93

Investigation Report
• cryogenic liquid piping supply application equipment;
• pressure relief devices;
• material compatibility;
• safety permissives, interlocks, and alarms;
• equipment clearances;
• SDS;
• product training materials; and
• equipment manuals and drawings.
When engaging in new business, Messer requires the following at a customer site:
• Permanently mounted atmospheric monitoring interlocked into application equipment or emergency
shut off valves that shut off supply of cryogenic liquid when in an alarm state;
• Proof of exhaust installed and interlocked into all application equipment that will not allow the flow of
cryogenic liquid when exhaust is not operating;
• Safe cryogenic liquid piping systems installed; and
• Presence of Messer nitrogen and/or carbon dioxide SDS and product safety sheets, and product safety
training materials.
For existing customers, Messer established a color-coded rating system, as shown in Figure 31. In response to a
customer rating of Red, Messer may choose to shut down the customer process.
94

Investigation Report
Figure 31. Messer customer safety rating system (Credit: Messer)
The CSB concludes Messer’s newly developed customer safety inspection program provides a robust review of
liquid nitrogen customer safety practices and can help prevent future incidents similar to the one at FFG.
Despite these positive changes, Messer’s product stewardship program does not involve any review or
participation in a customer’s PHA, a critical practice in which facility- and process-specific hazards are
identified and controlled. Although Messer cannot force its customers to conduct a PHA or to hire a third party
to conduct a PHA, Messer can participate in PHAs conducted by those customers willing to do so and can
consider taking any of the product stewardship actions discussed above for those customers unwilling to do so.
As discussed in Section 4.5.2, CGA P-86 states that organizations should complete a comprehensive risk
assessment to consider process safety risks to customers. In addition, as discussed in Section 4.1.2, CCPS
Guidelines for Hazard Evaluation Procedures provides guidance on PHA execution. Additionally, Messer’s
product stewardship program does not involve the verification of proper signage, labeling, and hazard
communication, nor does it explicitly mention emergency shutoff devices (E-stops). Therefore, the CSB
recommends that Messer update the company product stewardship policy to:
a) include participation by Messer in customers’ process hazard analyses (PHAs). The policy should
require that these PHAs be conducted in a manner which conforms with CCPS Guidelines for Hazard
Evaluation Procedures prior to the startup of a cryogenic freezing process;
b) require verification that proper signage, in accordance with CGA P-76 Hazards of Oxygen-Deficient
Atmospheres, is displayed on and/or near equipment; and
c) require a facility and/or equipment siting review to ensure that emergency shutoff devices, including E-
stops, are located such that they can be safely actuated during a release of liquid nitrogen.
In addition, the CSB recommends that Messer create an informational product that provides Messer customers
with information on the safety issues described in this report. In this informational product, recommend that
Messer customers develop and implement effective safety management systems to control asphyxiation hazards
from inert gases based on the guidance published in CGA P-86 Guideline for Process Safety Management, CGA
P-12 Guideline for Safe Handling of Cryogenic and Refrigerated Liquids, CGA P-18 Standard for Bulk Inert
Gas Systems, and CGA P-76 Hazards of Oxygen-Deficient Atmospheres.
95

Investigation Report
5 CONCLUSIONS
5.1 FINDINGS
Technical Analysis
1. Liquid nitrogen overflowed from the immersion freezer. The liquid nitrogen overflow was caused by the
failure of the freezer’s level control and high-level safety interlock systems.
2. The failure of the freezer’s level control and high-level safety interlock systems was caused by the
deformation of the bubbler tube.
3. The bubbler tube was likely bent on the morning of the incident during maintenance troubleshooting
activities, likely between 8:20 a.m. and approximately 9:30 a.m.
4. There was insufficient evidence to determine exactly when the tube was bent. Therefore, the CSB was
not able to determine precisely when the uncontrolled release began.
5. The CSB was not able to definitively determine how the tube was bent.
6. The CSB could not determine whether the two maintenance workers had sufficient awareness, time, and
ability to avert the release by activating an E-stop or to escape the room safely prior to the loss of
containment.
7. The uncontrolled release of liquid nitrogen likely ceased at approximately 10:15 a.m. when the bulk
storage tank manually-operated discharge valves, located outside the building, were closed.
8. At most, approximately 6,300 gallons (approximately 42,400 pounds) of liquid nitrogen released from
the FFG Line 4 immersion freezer, though the actual released quantity was likely less. There was
insufficient evidence to determine the exact quantity of released liquid nitrogen because it was not
possible to determine when the release began.
9. The released liquid nitrogen vaporized, collected in the freezer room, and produced an oxygen-deficient
atmosphere inside the room.
Single Point of Failure
10. The immersion freezer was designed such that the failure of a single level measurement device could
defeat both the nitrogen level control system and the emergency interlock intended to stop nitrogen flow
to the freezer. After the bubbler tube was bent, there was nothing to prevent the nitrogen release from
the freezer.
11. Linde did not design the immersion-spiral freezer in accordance with industry guidance regarding single
points of failure for instrumented systems. Had Linde or Messer included additional independent
safeguards to protect against overflow events, this incident could have been prevented.
96

Investigation Report
12. Linde did not adequately consider the failure of the liquid nitrogen level control system and did not
identify appropriate safeguards to mitigate the potential failure. In essence, Linde incorrectly identified
the bubbler tube as a safeguard for itself.
13. Linde did not identify specific incident scenarios or cause-consequence pairs when conducting the PHA
for the immersion-spiral freezer, which resulted in Linde’s failure to identify adequate safeguards to
protect against the overflow of liquid nitrogen from the immersion freezer.
14. Messer’s Quality Control procedures and practices were ineffective in ensuring that the two support
clamps on the bubbler tube were in place at the time of inspection. As a result, Messer failed to identify
the missing support clamp during Quality Control inspection.
15. The combination of unsecured tubing length and support clamp location worsened the potential for the
bubbler tube to become bent, which ultimately resulted in the bubbler system becoming non-functional.
Atmospheric Monitoring and Alarm Systems
16. Messer informed FFG of the need for atmospheric monitoring of its liquid nitrogen processes on at least
three occasions. Despite Messer’s recommendations, neither FFG nor Messer took action to install
monitoring or alarm equipment on the Line 4 process, which could have alerted workers to the presence
of an oxygen-deficient atmosphere, and, if designed accordingly, could have triggered an emergency
shutdown of the liquid nitrogen systems.
17. FFG did not follow industry guidance concerning the use of atmospheric monitoring and alarms for its
liquid nitrogen process, and as a result, many personnel were unaware that the freezer room was unsafe
to enter on the day of the incident.
18. Had Messer or FFG properly considered, designed, installed, tested, and maintained an atmospheric
monitoring and alarm system in the freezer room, workers would have been warned against entering the
oxygen-deficient atmosphere, which could have prevented the subsequent fatalities and serious injuries
to FFG workers.
19. Industry guidance for carbon dioxide is extensive. Comparable, specific guidance for liquid nitrogen
could help prevent future incidents similar to the one at FFG.
Emergency Preparedness
20. Although FFG had a written emergency action plan, it was severely inadequate to address a liquid
nitrogen emergency. Its inadequacies included 1) that it was not written in Spanish, the primary
language of many of FFG’s workers; 2) that it made no mention of the existence of liquid nitrogen at the
facility; 3) that it made no mention of the hazards of liquid nitrogen; 4) that it had no instructions for
how, whether, or when to respond to a release of liquid nitrogen other than general evacuation
instructions; 5) that it contained no information or plan for how employees were to be notified of an
emergency; 6) that it contained no information on what constituted an emergency or what types of
emergencies to which employees might need to respond; and 7) that it had no provision for proactively
interacting with local emergency responders despite the company’s stated practice of relying on them
for emergency response.
97

Investigation Report
21. As a result of FFG’s poor emergency communication, employees attempting to respond to the incident
or evacuate the building were only minimally informed, if at all, of the nature and severity of the
emergency.
22. The four workers who subsequently were fatally injured were attempting some sort of response to the
release.
23. FFG did not prepare its workforce in any meaningful way to respond to a release of liquid nitrogen. The
company’s deficiencies included 1) its lack of emergency response training for its workforce, 2) its lack
of employee training on how to identify a liquid nitrogen release, 3) the lack of automated means to
detect and inform its workers of a liquid nitrogen release, and 4) insufficient direction to its employees
not to respond or attempt rescue during a liquid nitrogen release.
24. As a result of FFG’s unpreparedness, the severity of the incident was greatly increased during
evacuation and response activities when four additional employees were fatally injured, three employees
were seriously injured, and at least seven others sustained minor injuries or were uninjured but easily
could have been seriously or fatally injured. Had FFG effectively prepared its workforce for a liquid
nitrogen release, the four additional fatalities and three of the four serious injuries could have been
prevented.
25. Gold Creek’s policy documents and emergency procedures are more robust than FFG’s emergency
action plan was at the time of the incident and could have reduced the severity of this incident had FFG
implemented similar policies and procedures.
26. The placement of the Line 4 immersion-spiral freezer E-stop buttons required a responding employee or
person not otherwise in the freezer room to enter an oxygen-deficient atmosphere during a release of
liquid nitrogen to activate an E-stop. This design was unsafe. As a result, once FFG’s two maintenance
workers became incapacitated, the uncontrolled liquid nitrogen release could not be safely stopped until
employees manually closed valves at the bulk liquid nitrogen storage tanks outside of the building, or
until emergency responders equipped for entry into an oxygen-deficient atmosphere could enter the
freezer room and activate an E-stop. Safer placement of E-stop buttons, and effective employee training
on their use, might have helped prevent the death of some or all of the four employees who perished
during emergency response.
27. Had FFG and Messer installed E-stop buttons outside the Line 4 freezer room, such as at the entrances
to the room or at the bulk storage tanks, the uncontrolled release could have been stopped more
expediently.
Process Safety Management System
28. For several months prior to the incident, FFG’s safety management organization did not include
employees with direct responsibility over the safety practices. Had FFG established process safety
programs and objectives; assigned qualified personnel clear responsibilities over process safety
management; defined, implemented, and tracked process safety objectives; and ensured organization
leaders demonstrated commitment to process safety principles, FFG could have prevented the incident.
98

Investigation Report
29. FFG did not identify or evaluate hazards specific to its process, such as the liquid nitrogen overflow and
asphyxiation risks, and did not implement effective controls to mitigate the risk.
30. FFG did not have written procedures to operate or maintain the liquid nitrogen freezer, and therefore the
FFG employees were not provided with clear instructions and precautions in operating the equipment.
Had FFG developed clear written procedures, it is likely that the FFG workers would have understood
the function of the freezer, the importance of critical components, and proper precautions when
operating and troubleshooting the equipment, which may have prevented the release.
31. FFG did not have a management of change process to identify, assess, and manage risk introduced by
process changes. During the introduction of the liquid nitrogen immersion-spiral freezer, FFG did not
consider how the change could impact process safety, did not include approval authorities with explicit
responsibilities for safety, and did not address conformance with industry guidance. As a result, FFG did
not manage the risks associated with using a mostly enclosed, partially recessed room without
mechanical ventilation and installed the liquid nitrogen freezer in an area particularly susceptible to an
oxygen-deficient atmosphere.
32. FFG had no system, plan, or program to train and verify the competency of its employees when
operating the liquid nitrogen freezer and working with or near hazardous liquid nitrogen. As a result,
FFG employees at all levels of the organization were not aware of the hazards of liquid nitrogen and
were unaware of precautions that should have been taken.
33. Had the liquid nitrogen freezer equipment and the entrance to the Line 4 freezer room been affixed with
proper warning signage and labels, workers could have been made aware of the asphyxiation risks
within the room.
34. FFG lacked an effective process safety management system to identify, evaluate, and control the
hazards of the liquid nitrogen process. The lack of safety oversight by FFG leadership, absence of a
systematic process hazard analysis, lack of written procedures, lack of any management of change
practices, and failure to communicate hazards resulted in the unmitigated handling of a cryogenic
asphyxiant by untrained and unprepared personnel. This incident could have been prevented had FFG
practiced robust process safety management.
35. There is no regulation requiring employers handling or processing cryogenic liquid asphyxiants, such as
liquid nitrogen, to adhere to industry guidance concerning proper design and safe handling, nor to
implement a robust and systematic approach to process safety. Because it was not required to, FFG did
not implement important process safety practices that could have either prevented the accidental release
or reduced its severity.
36. There is no specific guidance from OSHA on the process safety practices necessary for the safe use of
cryogenic asphyxiants.
Product Stewardship
37. Messer did not practice effective product stewardship prior to the incident. Messer was aware of several
instances of FFG’s process safety deficiencies and poor safety practices yet still commissioned the
freezer to FFG. Using more effective product stewardship, Messer could have prevented this incident by
99

Investigation Report
1) objecting to the placement of the freezer in a room particularly susceptible to oxygen deficiency, 2)
refusing to commission its freezer equipment until FFG provided adequate atmospheric monitoring and
alarm systems, 3) suspending supply of liquid nitrogen until safety deficiencies had been addressed, or
4) ending the relationship with FFG and removing its equipment.
38. Messer’s newly developed customer safety inspection program provides a robust review of liquid
nitrogen customer safety practices and can help prevent future incidents similar to the one at FFG.
5.2 CAUSE
The CSB determined the cause of the liquid nitrogen release was the failure of the immersion freezer’s liquid
level control system to accurately measure and control the liquid nitrogen level inside the freezer, which resulted
from deformation of the system’s bubbler tube component.
Contributing to the incident were 1) Messer’s design of the freezer, which allowed the failure of a single level
measurement device to result in an uncontrolled loss of containment of liquid nitrogen, 2) FFG’s lack of any
process safety management systems or practices that could have prevented the incident, 3) a lack of regulatory
coverage for liquid nitrogen, which enabled FFG to elect not to implement process safety practices that could
have prevented the incident, and 4) Messer’s inadequate product stewardship practices, which resulted in Messer
continuing to supply FFG with liquid nitrogen despite FFG’s unsafe practices.
Contributing to the severity of the incident were 1) FFG’s inadequate emergency preparedness, which resulted
in at least 14 employees responding to the release by entering the freezer room or the surrounding area to
investigate the incident or to attempt to rescue their coworkers, and 2) the absence of atmospheric monitoring
and alarm devices that could have alerted workers to the presence of a hazardous atmosphere and warned them
against entering.
100

Investigation Report
6 RECOMMENDATIONS
To prevent future chemical incidents, and in the interest of driving chemical safety excellence to protect
communities, workers, and the environment, the CSB makes the following safety recommendations:
6.1 GOLD CREEK FOODSa
2021-03-I-GA-R1
Include in the emergency action program provisions for proactively interacting with and informing local
emergency response resources of all emergencies at the former FFG Plant 4 facility to which Gold Creek
expects them to respond. At a minimum, Gold Creek should:
a) inform local emergency responders of the existence, nature, and location of hazardous substances at its
facilities, including liquid nitrogen;
b) inform local emergency responders of the location of emergency-critical equipment such as bulk storage
tanks, points of use, isolation valves, E-stop switches, and any other emergency equipment or systems
with which emergency responders may need to interact; and,
c) provide local emergency responders with information, such as facility plot plans, engineering drawings,
or other information needed to mount an effective emergency response.
6.2 MESSER LLCb
2021-03-I-GA-R2
Update the company product stewardship policy to:
a) include participation by Messer in customers’ process hazard analyses (PHAs). The policy should
require that these PHAs be conducted in a manner which conforms with CCPS Guidelines for Hazard
Evaluation Procedures prior to the startup of a cryogenic freezing process;
b) require verification that proper signage, in accordance with CGA P-76 Hazards of Oxygen-Deficient
Atmospheres, is displayed on and/or near equipment; and,
a
Gold Creek has developed emergency response procedures that could have reduced the severity of this incident. Consequently, the CSB
makes no recommendations to Gold Creek pertaining to the development of emergency preparedness policies or employee training for
its emergency action program. Additionally, as of this report’s publication, there are no liquid nitrogen freezing processes at the former
FFG Plant 4 building which Gold Creek now operates. Consequently, the CSB makes no recommendation to Gold Creek related to
process safety management practices for liquid nitrogen processes.
b
After the incident Messer revised its freezer design to include multiple layers of protection against liquid nitrogen overflow. Messer
also revised its Quality Control process and procedures to require verification of the presence of the necessary bubbler tube clamps and
reordered the sequence of inspection steps to facilitate this verification. Consequently, the CSB makes no recommendation to Messer
regarding the design of its immersion freezers or its Quality Control process.
101

Investigation Report
c) require a facility and/or equipment siting review to ensure that emergency shutoff devices, including E-
stops, are located such that they can be safely actuated during a release of liquid nitrogen.
2021-03-I-GA-R3
Create an informational product that provides Messer customers with information on the safety issues described
in this report. In this informational product, recommend that Messer customers develop and implement effective
safety management systems to control asphyxiation hazards from inert gases based on the guidance published in
CGA P-86 Guideline for Process Safety Management, CGA P-12 Guideline for Safe Handling of Cryogenic and
Refrigerated Liquids, CGA P-18 Standard for Bulk Inert Gas Systems, and CGA P-76 Hazards of Oxygen-

104

Investigation Report
7 KEY LESSONS FOR THE INDUSTRY
To prevent future chemical incidents, and in the interest of driving chemical safety excellence to protect
communities, workers, and the environment, the CSB urges companies to review these key lessons:
1. Processes and equipment that utilize hazardous materials should be designed robustly enough that the
failure of a single component cannot result in a catastrophic incident.
2. Facilities that handle hazardous gases or cryogenic asphyxiants should have a functioning atmospheric
monitoring and alarm system based on a properly conducted risk assessment. Functioning atmospheric
monitoring systems consist of equipment that has been properly designed, installed, maintained,
inspected, and tested and will alert personnel of a hazardous atmosphere using audible and visual
alarms.
3. Safety leadership begins with management. Designating competent and resourced staff with
responsibility over specific safety programs is key to ensuring effective process safety. Management
must be knowledgeable and involved in each of these safety programs to provide effective oversight.
4. A PHA can only be effective if it is specific to the process it evaluates. Not considering facility-specific
scenarios misses opportunities to effectively identify, evaluate, and control hazards. Companies
installing equipment into a process at their facility should always perform a PHA considering the
hazards introduced by the process, equipment, facility or room layout, surrounding area, and external
factors.
5. It is critical for workers to be trained on the hazards of the materials they encounter. Non-flammable,
non-toxic chemicals, such as nitrogen, can be incorrectly assumed to be non-hazardous without proper
training and hazard communication. Companies handling these materials have an obligation to train and
inform their employees.
6. Food manufacturers are not immune from chemical hazards and process safety risks. Whenever an
organization introduces a hazardous chemical into its process, it should implement robust process safety
management practices to effectively control the risks, regardless of whether any regulation requires the
organization to do so.
7. Regulations are minimum requirements. The need for robust process safety management practices exists
wherever hazardous chemicals are manufactured, processed, stored, and used, regardless of their
regulatory coverage. Companies must be cognizant of the hazards posed by the chemicals they handle
and should implement effective process safety management systems to control process safety risks.

project to make data from the American Community Survey easier to use. [It is] unaffiliated with the U.S. Census Bureau. A News
Challenge grant from the Knight Foundation funded the initial build-out of the site. … Support for [Census Reporter’s] 2020 Decennial
Census features was provided by the Google News Initiative. … [T]he Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University, home
of the Knight Lab, [] provides in-kind support for some of Census Reporter’s ongoing development. Most of [Census Reporter’s] server
hosting infrastructure is [] provided by the Oregon State University Open Source Lab” [51].
