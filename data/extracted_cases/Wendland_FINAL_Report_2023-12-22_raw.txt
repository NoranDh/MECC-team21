Investigation Report
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
On January 29, 2020, at approximately 3:00 p.m., the Daniel H. Wendland 1-H well (“Wendland 1-H well”),
located in Burleson County, Texas and operated by Chesapeake Operating, L.L.C. (Chesapeake), experienced a
loss of well control that resulted in a blowout of the well. Oil and gas escaped the well, and within seconds,
found an ignition source, resulting in a flash fire in the vicinity of the well that fatally injured three contract
workers and seriously injured another. One of the workers, who had been working close to the release point,
suffered fatal burn injuries and died at the incident site. Two others suffered serious burn injuries and later died
from their injuries. A fourth worker also suffered serious burn injuries but survived. All of the injured personnel
were contract workers from either Eagle PCO LLC (Eagle) or CC Forbes Energy Services (Forbes). At the time
of the incident, eleven contractors were working at the Wendland 1-H well site.
At the time of the incident, contract workers from Eagle were in the process of installing a new tubing head as
part of a workover operation. Workers from Forbes, who provided the workover rig, were near the Wendland 1-
H well preparing for their follow-on task of installing tubing in the well. Following the blowout, the ensuing
flash fire destroyed the workover rig and several nearby vehicles, resulting in an estimated $1 million in
property damage in addition to the fatalities and serious injuries.
The Caldwell Volunteer Fire Department, Texas Department of Public Safety, and others responded to the
incident.
SAFETY ISSUES
The CSB’s investigation identified the safety issues below.
• Well Planning. At the time of the incident, industry guidance stated that companies should plan for well
control prior to performing workover operations. Well planning procedures from industry guidance
included gathering well information, analyzing the information to predict potential hazards, and
formulating contingency plans to address these hazards. Chesapeake’s well control policies did not
incorporate this guidance, and Chesapeake did not adequately review the past history of the Wendland
1-H well, which would have indicated previous well control issues. A review of the well information,
conducted in accordance with industry guidance, could have resulted in the preparation of well control
procedures to properly isolate the hydrocarbons from the surface activity. (Section 4.1)
• Well Control for Completed Wells in Underpressured Reservoirs. Prior to installing the new tubing
head, Chesapeake’s contractors pumped 50 barrels (bbls) of 10-pound-per-gallon (ppg) brine with the
intent of providing hydrostatic pressure against the formation. The contractors also relied on open
surface valves as mechanical well control barriers. The intended well control barriers were ineffective in
preventing the loss of well control and subsequent blowout. Industry guidance does not provide reliable
well control methods for completed wells in underpressured reservoirs. Further, existing regulations do
not require the implementation and maintenance of well control for onshore oil and gas operations.
(Section 4.2)
Page 8

Investigation Report
• Ignition Source Management. At the time of the incident, a mixture of flammable hydrocarbons
released from the well and found an ignition source. Multiple potential ignition sources were identified
in the vicinity of the open wellbore. Chesapeake’s policies did not incorporate industry guidance
recommending that companies should perform hazard assessments when locating ignition sources and
atmospheric monitors near potentially flammable atmospheres. (Section 4.3)
• Federal Regulatory Safety Requirements. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) has historically exempted onshore oil and gas well drilling and servicing from its Control of
Hazardous Energy regulation at 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.147 as well as its Process
Safety Management (PSM) standard requirements under 29 CFR 1910.119. In addition, OSHA has not
developed a separate standard to cover onshore oil and gas drilling and servicing operations. As a result,
there are minimal regulations that govern onshore oil and gas drilling and servicing operations despite
prior attempts to promulgate special rules for this industry. (Section 4.4)
CAUSE
The CSB determined that the cause of the Wendland 1-H well blowout was the lack of well planning regarding
the implementation of well control. Insufficient industry guidance regarding well control for completed wells in
underpressured reservoirs contributed to the blowout, resulting in ineffective well control practices for these
types of wells. The attempted well control barriers were ineffective, resulting in the release of hydrocarbons that
ignited upon finding an ignition source.
The CSB also determined that ineffective ignition source management contributed to the fire, resulting in three
fatal injuries and one serious injury. The absence of regulations governing onshore oil and gas operations
contributed to the incident, resulting in the failure to both effectively control hazardous energy and implement
essential risk assessments that could have prevented this incident.

1.3 OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION IN THE UNITED STATES
In an effort to assist in energy policy decisions and to increase public awareness of energy in the United States,
the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) “collects, analyzes, and disseminates independent and
impartial energy information [4].” In December 2022, the EIA published a report titled “The Distribution of
U.S. Oil and Natural Gas Wells by Production Rate [5].” Appendix B of the EIA report shows that in 2021,
there were 318,256b oil wells in the United States (see Figure 3) that produced, on average, 15 barrels or less of
oil per day, with more than one-third of these wells (126,351) located in the state of Texas [5, pp. B22-B35].c

1.5 OIL PRODUCTION CONCEPTS AND TERMINOLOGY
1.5.1 PETROLEUM RESERVOIR BASICS
A petroleum reservoir, also called oil and gas reservoir (see Figure 5), is a subsurface accumulation
of hydrocarbons contained in porous or fractured rock formations. The hydrocarbons are trapped by overlying
impermeable layers of rock [6].
Figure 5. Schematic depicting a petroleum reservoir (Credit: University of Calgary, Energy Education [6])
Wells are drilled and produced to extract oil and gas from the reservoir [7]. As the well is drilled, casing is
placed into the drilled hole and cemented in place [8]. The casing is large diameter pipe that serves as the
wellbore [9]. Once the well has reached the depth of the productive formation, the well is completed in order to
provide an open path between the wellbore and the oil or gas reservoir [10].
1.5.2 RESERVOIR PRESSURE AND HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE
The reservoir pressure is the pressure of fluid in the pore spaces within formation rock [11, 12] and is measured
under static, non-flowing conditions [1].
Page 18

Investigation Report
Reservoir pressure for a given reservoir is characterized as either overpressured [13], normally pressured [1], or
underpressured [13]. This characterization depends on the relationship of the reservoir pressure to normal
hydrostatic pressure (see Figure 6). Hydrostatic pressure is defined as the pressure that exists at any point in a
column of fluid, such as in a wellbore, due to the weight of the vertical column of fluid above that point [1].
Referring to Figure 6, in normally pressured reservoirs, the reservoir pressure is equal to the hydrostatic
pressure of formation water measured at the reservoir depth [1]. In an overpressured reservoir, the reservoir
pressure exceeds the hydrostatic pressure of a column of formation water [13].
Figure 6. Graphical representation of reservoir pressure characterizations. (Credit: CSB)
Newly discovered reservoirs may be overpressured (see Figure 7), meaning that wells drilled and completed
into these formations will flow to the surface unassisted [13]. Over time, as oil and gas are produced from the
reservoir, the pressure gradually decreases [13]. When the reservoir pressure is decreased to the point that the
reservoir is underpressured, the well will no longer naturally flow to the surface on its own [14, p. 223]. The
reservoir pressure in these underpressured reservoirs is too low to support a column of fluid to the surface (see
Figure 7). An artificial lift method, such as using a pumping unit with a downhole pump (see Figure 7, right
side), may be added, which allows continuing production from wells in underpressured reservoirs [12]. Being in
an underpressured reservoir, the Wendland 1-H well produced oil via artificial lift using a pumping unit with a
downhole pump.

1.5.3 WELL WORKOVERS
During the life of producing oil and gas wells, they occasionally require routine services or additional well work
known as workovers. During well workovers, remedial work (i.e., maintenance or repair) is done on the well
that may involve repairs or other procedures to increase the production flow rate [1]. Workovers are performed
using a workover rig (see Figure 8). The well is shut in,a and production equipment, such as the pumping unit,
is isolated and certain equipment is removed to allow the workover rigb to prepare for the well work.
a
When a well is “shut in,” the flow paths for formation fluids to the surface are closed [41].
b
The workover rig was not being used at the time of the January 29, 2020, incident.

1.5.4 WELL CONTROL
Workover fluids are used in conjunction with the workover procedure to provide well control, which is
discussed in the next section [15]. Well control [1] refers to methods used to minimize the potential for an influx
of fluids into the wellbore from the formation, also called a kick [1], which can lead to uncontrolled flow to the
surface, also called a blowout [1]. According to the American Petroleum Institute (API), a kick will occur if the
reservoir pressure exceeds the wellbore pressure and sufficient permeability exists within the reservoir [16, p.
32].
When the pressure exerted by the hydrostatic fluid column in the wellbore exceeds the reservoir pressure, the
well is overbalanced (see Figure 9) [1], resulting in a hydrostatic barrier that prevents formation fluids from
entering the wellbore [16, p. 7]. When the hydrostatic pressure in the wellbore is less than the reservoir pressure,
the well is underbalanced, and reservoir fluids can flow into the wellbore (see Figure 10) [1].

Well control is accomplished by establishing and maintaining barriers to protect against a hydrocarbon blowout
[16, p. 54]. The Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS) provides the following definition of “barrier” that
can apply to onshore oil and gas operations:
A control measure or grouping of controls that on its own can prevent a threat developing into a top
event (prevention barrier) or can mitigate the consequences of a top event once it has occurred
(mitigation barrier). A barrier must be effective, independent, and auditable [17, p. 31].

2 INCIDENT DESCRIPTION
2.1 WORKOVER PLANNING
In November 2019, Chesapeake suspected that a hole had formed in the tubing of the Wendland 1-H well due to
the loss of oil production. Then, on November 26, 2019, Chesapeake discovered a possible hole in the tubing at
a measured depth of 3,674 feet, preventing the well from producing oil (see Figure 11). The well stopped
producing oil on November 20, 2019, and continued to produce natural gas until January 18, 2020. On January
26, 2020, the contract Onsite Supervisor from SDS Petroleum arrived at the well to prepare for the upcoming
workover to repair the tubing.

The scope of the planned workover was, in part, to assess the tubing and replace one or more tubing joints, as
necessary.
2.2 WORKOVER ACTIVITIES
On January 27, 2020, the Onsite Supervisor had a construction crew prepare the location for the workover rig to
address excessive mud at the well site. Just before 10:00 a.m., after the workover rig arrived, the Onsite
Supervisor held a Pre-Job Safety Assessment and reported a shut-in tubing pressure and shut-in casing
pressure of 80 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) on the well. The Onsite Supervisor then had the hot oil

Investigation Report
contractor from A&La pump five barrels (bbls) of treated water into the well through the tubing to confirm the
hole in the tubing. The Onsite Supervisor stated that they did not see a pressure increase in the tubing,b which
indicated that the tubing was leaking.
The Onsite Supervisor then had A&L switch to pumping treated hot water, and A&L pumped an additional 20
bbls of treated hot waterc into the well. After lunch, the workover rig crew from Forbes began pulling the rod
string (see Figure 12) out of the wellbore. Before ending work for the day, the Onsite Supervisor had the hot oil
contractor pump 45 more barrels of treated hot water into the well for paraffin removal.

a
The job of the hot oil contractor was to pump water or brine into the well as needed.
b
When brine was pumped into the tubing, the crew should have seen a rise in pressure once the fluid column in the tubing reached the
surface.
c
The purpose of using hot water was to remove paraffin, a waxy hydrocarbon compound, from the rod string.
Page 24

Investigation Report
On Tuesday, January 28, 2020, the rig crew continued to pull out and inspect all of the rods. After the rig crew
finished pulling out the rods, Chesapeake communicated a new task to change the existing tubing head to ensure
the tubing head assembly, including the casing valves and connections, were rated to 5,000 pounds per square
inch (psi). At around 2:45 p.m., the rig crew completed pulling out the rods and began to pull out and scan the
tubing looking for signs of corrosion.
At around 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, January 29, 2020, the Onsite Supervisor reported they had completed
pulling the remaining tubing joints from the well and were digging out the cellar (see Figure 1) to access the
tubing head (see Figure 13) for replacement.a The work crew, consisting of Forbes and Eagle workers, then
installed a tubing head adapter, a lifting sub, and a stabbing valve (see Figure 14 and Figure 15) on top of the
existing tubing head to facilitate replacement.

a
The well cellar refers to “a stabilized excavation around the wellhead to provide space for equipment at the top of the wellbore.” The
work crew used a high-pressure washer with vacuum to try and clean out the cellar, and they also dug it out with a shovel when the
pressure washer was no longer effective.

The Onsite Supervisor instructed A&L, the hot oil contractor, to pump an additional 50 bbls of 10-pound-per-
gallon (ppg) brinea into the casing before removing the existing tubing head to establish a hydrostatic barrier.
About 15 minutes after pumping the brine into the well, a “little puff” of gas came out of the well,b after which
the Onsite Supervisor believed the well to be static, or non-flowing. Figure 16 depicts the well schematics
showing the work progression up to the point of removing the existing tubing head, described by the following:

The CSB could not confirm the fluid quantities or densities.

According to the Onsite Supervisor, it was normal to see some gas come out of the Wendland 1-H well after pumping fluid into the
well.

After removing the old tubing head, the work crew, likely consisting of Forbes and Eagle workers, then
reinstalled the flange, ring, and lifting sub with shut-off valve on the top of the new tubing head and lifted the
tubing head assembly onto the well. After hand-tightening all of the flange bolts, workers from Eagle torqued
four of the bolts while the Onsite Supervisor remained at the well site. To torque the bolts on the new tubing
head, Eagle workers used a remote-controlled torque wrench powered using an electric hydraulic pump (power
pack). The new casing valves and the stabbing valve were left open throughout the installation and bolt-up.a
These valves were intentionally left open due to concerns about experiencing well pressure while the tubing
head was being installed.
2.3 WELL BLOWOUT AND FIRE
At about 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday, January 29, 2020, the installation crew from Eagle was in the process of
torquing the bolts attaching the tubing head to the top casing flange when the well began releasing oil and gas
through the open stabbing valve and casing valves, as depicted in Figure 17. One worker described feeling
drops of oil followed by an “explosion” as the oil and gas released from the well. Shortly after the blowout
began, the hydrocarbons ignited, engulfing the area around the well in flames.
a
One of the casing valves was plugged at the time of the incident. Although the casing valve was open, the plug prevented the flow of
hydrocarbons through the valve.

2.4 EMERGENCY RESPONSE
After the blowout, the supervisor reported seeing workers evacuating from the well area. The supervisor noted
that after arriving at the muster point and conducting an accountability check, one person was missing and three
other workers were badly burned. Witnesses indicated that three Eagle personnel were working in the cellar at
the time of the incident. Figure 18 shows the locations of equipment once the fire was extinguished.

At 4:10 p.m., Chesapeake noted that one Eagle employee was still missing and two of the injured personnel had
been transported to Seton Austin Burn Center. At around 5:20 p.m., first responders began moving toward the
well to search for the missing Eagle employee. Just before 6:00 p.m., the missing Eagle employee was found
deceased near the well. At around 7:00 p.m., Chesapeake reported dry gas exiting the well, slight flow of oil
exiting the casing valves, and no fluids leaving the area of the wellhead. Local fire departments reported the fire
was controlled at 8:00 p.m., and Chesapeake reported seeing no fire coming from the well, with very little flow
from the well, at 9:07 p.m. Personnel noted intermittent fires in and around the well until the morning of January
30, 2020. Contracted response personnel from Halliburton Boots & Cootsa conducted clean-up efforts for the
remainder of the day to prepare for well control operations. At 2:30 p.m. on January 31, 2020, the contracted
response crew reported the well was successfully shut in.

2.5 INCIDENT CONSEQUENCES
As a result of the incident, three workers were fatally injured and one worker was seriously injured. One worker
from Eagle was fatally injured at the well site. Three other workers, two from Eagle and one from Forbes,
suffered serious burn injuries, and two of these workers, one from each company, later succumbed to their
injuries. In addition to causing these fatalities and serious injuries, the blowout resulted in an estimated property
damage greater than $1 million.a On April 5, 2021, Chesapeake plugged and abandoned the well.
a
This estimate was obtained using the Chesapeake-provided estimate of its own property damage ($249,000) and an estimate of the cost
of an equivalent model workover rig ($780,000). Further, the estimate does not include the damages to Eagle or A&L equipment.

3 TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
3.1 WELLBORE CONDITIONS ON THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT
A narrative and physical description of the reservoir and wellbore conditions that led to the Wendland 1-H
blowout are provided below.
Initial Conditions
A workover rig had been at the Wendland 1-H well location since Monday, January 27, 2020. Each morning, the
crew recorded the shut-in pressure. On Wednesday morning, January 29, 2020, the day of the incident, the shut-
in pressure read 50 psig (Figure 19, left). The wellbore fluid level was approximately 4,850 feet below the
ground level based on a recent survey. The pressure measured at the surface indicated that gas had evolved from
the wellbore fluid column and the well was not dead [13].a When the crew arrived at the well, they opened up
the well, and bled off the pressure, but gas continued to evolve, rise up the wellbore, and exit the well from
surface valves open to the atmosphere (Figure 19, right).
a
A well is considered to be “dead” if the shut-in pressure reads zero, which indicates the well is essentially balanced. In this condition,
the well can normally be opened safely to the atmosphere.

CSB)
Attempt to Establish Well Control
As shown in Figure 20 (left), at approximately 1:00 p.m. on Wednesday, January 29, 2020, work began on the
tubing head replacement. To prepare for this work, the Onsite Supervisor had A&L pump 50 bbls of 10-ppg
brine into the wellbore. The volume and weight of the brine fluid was chosen based on the Onsite Supervisor’s
understanding of Chesapeake’s practice resulting from a previous conversation with a Chesapeake employee.
The intent of pumping this brine fluid was to establish a hydrostatic barrier for well control (see Section 1.5.4).
No mechanical barrier was installed in the well.

Figure 20 depicts the pumping of the brine, the temporary level increase in the wellbore, and the subsequent
falling of the brine through the other wellbore fluids to the lower parts of the wellbore. The 50 bbls of brine
temporarily added 1,270 feet, resulting in an overbalance against the formation face of 660 psi (calculations are
contained in Appendix B), providing sufficient hydrostatic pressure to prevent formation fluids from entering
the wellbore.b

Investigation Report
Off-Gassing and Outflow of Fluids
While the brine was dropping through the wellbore fluids, the entrained gas in the fluid column was displaced
up the wellbore and vented to the atmosphere. This venting of gas, or “off-gassing,” was noted by the Onsite
Supervisor and members of the different work crews.
The overbalance in the wellbore due to the added brine resulted in outflow of fluids from the wellbore into the
formation (see Figure 21) [14, p. 207] [18, p. 231]. The rate of fluid loss into the reservoir is influenced by
several factors, including pressure differential, fluid viscosity, and completion interval length [14, pp. 208-209].
The well's long completion interval and underpressured reservoir exacerbated the loss of fluid to the reservoir.
The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB calculateda that the rate of fluid loss to the
reservoir was between 15 and 40 bbl/hour. At that rate, the 50 bbls of brine fluid would have been lost to the
reservoir within 1.3 to 3.5 hours, resulting in the loss of the hydrostatic barrier.
Figure 21. Graphical depiction of wellbore conditions within two hours of blowout. (Credit: CSB)
While fluids drained out of the well into the reservoir, the wellbore experienced a vacuum (see Figure 21)
caused by the falling fluid level. The addition of fluid into the wellbore also resulted in some of the gas in the
wellbore being displaced and rising to the surface, where it vented for about a minute. The vacuum and
subsequent venting of gas, according to the Onsite Supervisor, were expected conditions following the addition
of fluid into the wellbore. Immediately after the pumping of brine fluid, the wellbore was temporarily
overbalanced, resulting in a time-limited hydrostatic barrier. At this point, after seeing a vacuum and gas
a

Investigation Report
venting, the Onsite Supervisor and other personnel believed that the wellbore was “static” or “dead” and that it
was safe to do work on the well (Figure 21, right).
Fluid losses to the reservoir and the associated loss of fluid level continued in the Wendland 1-H wellbore as
shown in Figure 22 [18, p. 231]. As fluid level was lost in the wellbore, fluid overbalance against the formation
was lost as well. As the fluid level dropped, the top of the completion interval became underbalanced first.
When the top of the zone became underbalanced, gas began to flow into the wellbore. This gas inflow from the
top of the completion interval occurred while fluid drained from the wellbore into the lower part of the
completion interval [18, p. 231] [14, p. 207]. This wellbore dynamic is shown in Figure 22. Gas entered the
wellbore, began flowing to the surface, and since the wellbore remained open, gas vented at the surface (Figure
22, right).

Well Blowout
Before the Wendland 1-H oil blowout to the surface occurred, workers at the location reported seeing gas
venting from the well. Workers from Eagle were in the process of bolting up the wellhead when the release
suddenly transitioned to a large volume of oil and gas. Figure 23 depicts the final stage leading to the blowout
and the oil and gas blowout event.

Investigation Report

Change in the Reservoir Conditions
When Chesapeake’s contractors began the workover on Monday, January 27, 2020, the well’s shut-in pressure
was 80 psig. At the start of work on Tuesday, January 28, 2020, the shut-in pressure was also 80 psig. On the
morning of Wednesday, January 29, 2020, the shut-in pressure was 50 psig. After the incident, the shut-in
pressure increased to around 400 psig, indicating a change from the reservoir conditions observed before the
workover began. The fact that the well was previously on artificial lift and then flowed oil to the surface during
the blowout also indicates a change had occurred in the reservoir conditions [12].
Potential reasons for changes in the reservoir that could have led to the well fluids flowing to the surface and
increasing the shut-in pressure post-event include the following:
1. Communication with other nearby wellsa undergoing high-pressure injection or hydraulic fracturing
(called “fracking”). Communication with nearby “fracked” wells is called frac interference or “frac
hits.”
2. Destabilizing the reservoir at or near the formation face (i.e., inadvertent stimulation) during reverse
flow into the reservoir.
a
Communication between two wells occurs when a flow path exists between the two wellbores.
Page 36

Investigation Report
3. Varying permeabilities and porosities within a reservoir can result in areas of higher pressure that were
not previously accessed [19].
4. The lightening of the wellbore oil column by the gas percolating through the fluid column, which could
have also contributed to the release of oil to the surface [20].
The increase in shut-in pressure following the incident indicated that a change in reservoir conditions occurred.
Based on the lack of the ability to continuously monitor reservoir conditions and the lack of available
information on offset fracking operations, the CSB was unable to determine which of the above reasons for the
change, or which combination of reasons, caused the increase in reservoir pressures.
The CSB concludes that the well blowout occurred as a result of both a loss of fluid overbalance and a change in
the reservoir conditions, allowing oil and gas to flow to the surface.

Investigation Report
4 SAFETY ISSUES
The following sections discuss the safety issues contributing to the incident, which include:
• Well Planning
• Well Control for Completed Wells in Underpressured Reservoirs
• Ignition Source Management
• Federal Regulatory Safety Requirements
A graphical causal analysis is included in Appendix A.
4.1 WELL PLANNING
The Well Planning section of the American Petroleum Institute’s (API) Recommended Practice (RP) 59,
Recommended Practice for Well Control Operations, which is intended to prevent the release of hydrocarbons
from a well, advises to first gather well information, then to analyze the data and formulate a list of potentially
hazardous events, and finally to determine safeguards against hazardous events. API RP 59 also states that
“operating procedures should be prepared and posted.” Although much of this section of API RP 59 is intended
to be implemented prior to drilling, it is also applicable to workover operations [16, p. 38].
Well History Review
Chesapeake did not include in its policies a stipulation to conduct a well history review, and neither Chesapeake
nor its contractors reviewed the workover history to evaluate previous well control operations. A planning
review per API RP 59 would have included, among other things, a review of well control indications and any
well control problems. The CSB conducted a review of the Wendland 1-H well’s workovers, and details of the
CSB’s review are contained in Appendix C. The CSB’s review of that history identified at least 22 prior well
control eventsa and records of “off-gassing” at the Wendland 1-H well during 34 workovers since 1993.
Had this information been reviewed at some point prior to the incident, Chesapeake and its contractors may have
recognized that the historical approach of pumping a batch volume of fluid into the well was ineffective. A
complete workover history review also would have revealed that the Wendland 1-H well, in some instances, was
capable of flowing, as shown in Appendix C.
The CSB concludes that a review of the well history, as recommended by API RP 59, would have revealed past
instances where the Wendland 1-H well could flow oil during a workover. Such recognition may have led to
heightened awareness of the potential for well control problems and earlier action taken to maintain well
control.
a
For the purposes of this report, a “well control event” is defined as an unplanned release of hydrocarbons from the well.

Investigation Report
The CSB recommends that Chesapeake develop or revise policies incorporating the recommendations of API
RP 59 regarding well planning, specifically the inclusion of well history review in conjunction with workover
well control planning.

The CSB concludes that Chesapeake did not provide written operating
or contingency procedures for establishing and maintaining well
control. Had Chesapeake and its contractors performed well planning in
accordance with API RP 59, an operating procedure describing the instructions for establishing and maintaining
well control would have been prepared and posted for use by contractors performing the workover operations.
Following the incident, Chesapeake implemented well control procedure templates for several standard
workover procedures, including casing valve replacements and addressing holes in tubing. These templates can
be used in future workovers to develop site-specific workover well control procedures, provided the procedures
are based on the respective well history.
4.2 WELL CONTROL FOR COMPLETED WELLS IN UNDERPRESSURED
RESERVOIRS
A well is considered “completed” once the well is constructed and is ready to begin producing hydrocarbons
[21]. After a well is completed and producing, workover operations, such as the workover being performed on
the Wendland 1-H well at the time of the incident, are performed as necessary to repair or service the well. In
Page 39

Investigation Report
API RP 59, Recommended Practice for Well Control Operations, the API provides well control procedures
“intended to safely prevent or handle kicksa and re-establish primary well control” [16, p. 6].
Methods that stop fluids from reaching the surface and exiting the well are preventive. Well control can also
refer to methods that maintain control of the well in the event of a flow event or kick. These methods are
mitigative. A typical method for preventive well control is using a hydrostatic barrier, also referred to as the
primary well control barrier. Mitigative controls applied after flow has reached the surface are also referred to as
secondary barriers. Closure of blowout preventers (BOPs) and valves at the surface are commonly used as
secondary barriers for well control barriers. The BowTie diagram below shows the relationship of well control
barriers to a blowout event (Figure 24).

adapted by CSB [22])
Challenges to Achieving Well Control in Completed Wells
As API RP 59 explains, primary well control is normally accomplished by maintaining “hydrostatic pressure in
the wellbore that is equal to or greater than the formation pressure,” [16, p. 7] thereby preventing flow from the
formation into the wellbore, known as an influx [16, p. 4]. The Wendland 1-H well presented several challenges
regarding primary well control using a hydrostatic barrier:
Open path to the reservoir
First, during a workover, completed wells have an open path through the completion interval to the
reservoir [17, p. 69] [23, pp. 22-3].
Clear fluids
a
The API describes a “kick” as “formation flow during…well servicing operations [16, p. 6].”
Page 40

Investigation Report
Second, to prevent formation damage, a hydrostatic barrier in completed wells typically uses clear,a
solids-free fluids. The use of clear, solids-free fluids, like the brine used as a workover fluid in this
instance, increases the risk of fluid losses to the formation compared with typical drilling fluids [14, p.
2].
Underpressured reservoir
Third, this reservoir was underpressured. Fluid added to the wellbore initially provides overbalance
against the formation. However, in underpressured reservoirs, the fluid added will flow into the
reservoir until overbalance is lost. When overbalance is lost, an influx, or kick, can enter the wellbore
[18, p. 231] [23, pp. 22-3]. Several texts highlight the potential for simultaneous fluid losses to one zone
while gas or liquids may be entering the wellbore from another higher zone in the same reservoir [23,
pp. 4, 10] [17, p. 70] [14, p. 207].
High gas-to-oil ratio
Fourth, the Wendland 1-H well produced oil and gas at a gas-oil ratio ranging between 3,000 and 8,300
standard cubic feet per barrel. In the months leading up to the incident when the well was not producing
any oil, the well continued to produce gas, as much as 77,000 cubic feet per day. The lighter natural gas
will rise through the workover fluids toward the surface and off-gas if a barrier does not prevent that
flow [23, p. 2].
Because of these challenges, well control methods in completed wells—especially in underpressured
reservoirs—require special considerations [23, pp. 1, 6] [14, p. 2]. The following are some specific examples of
methods that can be used to accomplish effective well control in completed wells in underpressured reservoirs:
1) Continuous fluid addition. If clear fluids are used such as fresh water or brine without additives, the
fluid must be continually added [23, pp. 2, 5] [18, p. 231] [14, p. 208]. Where feasible, continuous fluid
addition can maintain an overbalanced condition in a wellbore, provided that the rate at which it is
added exceeds the rate at which it flows from the wellbore into the reservoir.
2) Viscous fluids. Viscous fluids can be used to prevent the loss of the hydrostatic barrier by placing a
batch of thick, high viscosity fluid into the wellbore known as a fluid loss control pill [14, p. 208].
Polymers such as hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) and xanthan gum (XC) can also be added to workover
fluids to increase the viscosity [18, pp. 231-232]. High viscosity fluids will decrease the fluid flow rate
from the wellbore into the formation, allowing an overbalanced condition to exist for a longer duration.
3) Bridging solids. Mixing bridging solids into the workover fluid can also prevent fluid losses to the
formation. Bridging agents mechanically block the leak paths. Non-damaging bridging solids are
described by Crumpton and others [14, pp. 210-212] [18, pp. 232, 243]. Blocking leak paths from the
wellbore into the reservoir would prevent fluid losses and maintain a hydrostatic barrier for a longer
duration.
4) Mechanical barriers. Setting a mechanical barrier can address fluid losses in situations where the
wellbore configuration allows for setting a plug [14, p. 212] [16, p. 54]. The mechanical plug must be
set above the top of the completed zone [18, p. 234].
a
Some workover fluids are commonly referred to as “clear” fluids, as they contain no suspended solids [42].
Page 41

Investigation Report
4.2.1 INEFFECTIVE HYDROSTATIC BARRIER
Chesapeake’s Barrier Policy outlined the “minimum expectations for both the number and selection of [well
control] barriers” for all well operations, including workovers. This policy defined a “barrier” as “a component
or practice that contributes to the total system reliability by preventing liquid or gas flow, when properly
executed.” As discussed in Section 2.2, prior to removing the existing tubing head, the Onsite Supervisor, based
on the perception of Chesapeake’s usual practice, attempted a hydrostatic barrier using 50 bbls of 10-ppg brine.
As shown in Figure 24, establishing and maintaining of an effective hydrostatic barrier is necessary to prevent
formation fluids from entering the wellbore, which could result in a loss of well control. Chesapeake directed
the use of brine, a clear fluid, in an attempt to establish and maintain a hydrostatic barrier. Given the use of a
clear fluid in an underpressured reservoir, it would have been necessary to continuously add the fluid exceeding
the rate of fluid loss in order to achieve an overbalance for the duration of the task of replacing the tubing head.
The Onsite Supervisor did not do this, however.
Chesapeake also could have instructed the Onsite Supervisor to use a high viscosity fluid instead of brine as a
workover fluid. As demonstrated in calculations in Appendix B, a higher viscosity fluid would have resulted in
a slower fluid loss rate into the reservoir, resulting in a greater duration of overbalance in the wellbore. Because
of the longer duration of overbalance, this method would have been a more effective hydrostatic barrier option
than using brine.
At the time of the incident, Chesapeake’s Barrier Policy did not contain provisions for using continuous fluid
addition or high viscosity workover fluids as hydrostatic barriers. Inclusion of these methods into Chesapeake’s
policy may have resulted in the use of one of these methods instead of simply using a batch volume of brine.
The CSB concludes that Chesapeake failed to provide effective well control guidance, and Chesapeake’s
contractors failed to maintain an effective hydrostatic barrier because Chesapeake’s Barrier Policy did not
incorporate appropriate methods for maintaining a hydrostatic barrier for a completed well in an underpressured
reservoir.
Following the incident, Chesapeake superseded its Barrier Policy with a Barrier Standard that includes the
requirement to maintain fluid levels and conditions. Chesapeake also implemented Barrier Exception Procedures
that apply to specific circumstances during workovers, which include the use of continuous fluid addition to
establish and maintain a hydrostatic barrier.
4.2.2 INEFFECTIVE SECONDARY BARRIER
According to the International Association of Drilling Contractors (IADC), a “secondary well barrier” is defined
as a “second set of well barrier elements that prevent flow from…” an influx of formation fluids [24]. In
addition to the attempted hydrostatic barrier discussed in Section 4.2.1, Chesapeake and its contractors used an
open stabbing valve and the open casing valves as secondary well control barriers. As shown in Figure 24, a
secondary barrier is a mitigative control that provides protection against an incident to prevent a blowout after
well control has been lost.
Page 42

Investigation Report
Chesapeake’s Workover and Completions BOP Manual (BOP Manual) addresses Chesapeake’s minimum
requirements for blowout prevention equipment used in workover operations. One of the BOP Manual’s stated
objectives is to prevent unplanned releases. The manual discusses stabbing valves,a also called a full-opening
safety valve (FOSV). Figure 25 shows an exemplar FOSV and the FOSV in use at the time of the incident. The
Barrier Policy listed an FOSV as an example of a mechanical barrier, and the BOP Manual lists the
requirements for using an FOSV. Among those requirements are that an FOSV with its operating wrench must
be available and on the rig floor at all times. The BOP Manual also notes that the FOSV is “only to be used as
an emergency valve during well control operations.”
Figure 25. Cutaway view of exemplar FOSV (left) (Credit M&M International [25]) and the FOSV used at the
time of the incident (right). (Credit: CSB).
During this incident, the FOSV was installed and open versus “on the rig floor,” and Chesapeake told the CSB
that it considered an open FOSV to be a barrier per its policies. With the tubing head and casing valves
disconnected from pressure-measuring equipment, however, there was no way to monitor for changes within the
wellbore indicating the occurrence of a kick. Therefore, the open FOSV and casing valves would have only been
closed upon (1) human detection of an influx and (2) human action to close the valves. As illustrated in Figure
24, any open surface valve requiring closure for barrier implementation constitutes a mitigative barrier, making
it less reliable. Also, since the new tubing head was not yet fully bolted into place, it did not meet the criteria to
be considered a barrier.
a
The IADC identifies “stabbing valve” as a safety valve and defines it as “a full opening valve available for quick installation…” [43].
Page 43

Investigation Report
In addition to being a less reliable mitigative barrier, the human action of closing a stabbing valve in response to
a blowout would place a worker in the immediate vicinity of a flammable atmosphere with a potentially spark-
producing hand tool, increasing the risk of a flash fire. The Onsite Supervisor described the operation of a
stabbing valve to the CSB:
But [the] first move is [to] always…always get the [stabbing] valve in there.
That’s the very first move. You may put…it on there…in an open position, never
closed. If it’s closed and it starts blowing water and gas, …it’s harder to screw
down when it’s under pressure. So if it’s blowing, you get it screwed on there.
Then you shut the valve…then everything’s safe.
To further illustrate the hazards associated with the use of stabbing valves, Figure 26 and Figure 27 show two
examples of workers using or attempting to use stabbing valves to shut in wells.
Figure 26. Attempt to install a stabbing valve, with the sequence described as follows: (1) As the blowout
progresses, three workers (indicated with arrows) approach the release point, (2) the first attempt to line up
the pipe to which the stabbing valve is attached, (3) pressure pushes the pipe away from well, (4) the second
attempt to line up the pipe, (5) workers successfully line up the pipe and attempt to thread it onto the well, (6)
pressure again pushes the pipe away from the well. (Credit: YouTube [26], annotations by CSB)

The CSB concludes that the use of open surface valves and stabbing valves as a well control barrier is not
effective since it (1) is a mitigative control actuated after the release begins and (2) increases the risks to
workers in the event of a release by creating a flammable vapor cloud around them with potential ignition
sources nearby.

4.2.3 INDUSTRY GUIDANCE
API RP 59, Recommended Practice for Well Control Operations, provides guidance on well control operations
and is intended to be used both as a well control field aid and as a technical source for well control instruction.
API RP 59 establishes recommended practices for preventing a loss of well control and, if a loss of well control
occurs, recommended practices to re-establish well control [16, p. 1].
Establishing a Primary Barrier
Section 5 of API RP 59 states that one of the conditions necessary for a kick is insufficient hydrostatic pressure
[16, p. 32]. API RP 59 further states that failure to maintain a full column of fluid, among other conditions, can
result in the loss of well control [16, p. 32]. For wells in underpressured reservoirs like the Wendland 1-H well,
API RP 59 Section 5.2.3.2 states that “consideration should be given to keeping a volume of fluid in reserve to
add…into the well as needed to maintain control” [16, p. 32]. This is the only instance in API RP 59 that
addresses well control for completed wells in underpressured reservoirs.
In an underpressured well such as the Wendland 1-H well, the use of water, brine, or other clear fluids makes it
difficult, if not impossible, to monitor from the surface since these fluids would be lost to the formation [14, p.
236]. Therefore, the guidance provided by API is not conducive to establishing an effective hydrostatic barrier
since any reserve fluid added to a well would simply be lost to the formation and cannot be monitored. Further,
API RP 59 does not discuss special considerations in addressing the specific challenges with well control in
completed wells, including in underpressured reservoirs, as discussed in Section 4.1.
The CSB concludes that the present API guidance for well control involving completed wells in underpressured
reservoirs is not adequate for the implementation of an effective hydrostatic barrier. Had more robust guidance
been presented in API RP 59, Chesapeake may have instituted more effective well control practices, potentially
preventing the incident from occurring.
Establishing a Secondary Barrier
Like Chesapeake’s BOP Manual, API RP 59 also references the use of a safety valve when “handling pressure,”
implying that the use of a stabbing valve like the FOSV used at the time of the incident may constitute a
secondary well control barrier. For the reasons stated in Section 4.2.2, the CSB concludes that the use of
stabbing valves, as mentioned in API RP 59, is not an effective well control barrier.
API RP 59 Section 11.11.1 states, “If a well is considered to have potential to flow, maintenance of…two
barriers to [a] flow system should be considered,” including fluid overbalance, mechanical devices, and plugs
[16, p. 54]. Further, Section 11.11.2 lists other practices for handling pressure, one of which is having a stabbing
valve available on the rig floor [16, p. 54].

The Onsite Supervisor stated further:
So…having some…vapors at the surface is…not a real great concern. I
mean…it’s a common thing. I mean…there’s a difference between having vapors

One worker noticed gas coming out of the well before they removed the existing tubing head and notified the
Onsite Supervisor. After the Onsite Supervisor indicated that they would be safe, the worker expressed no
concern about a potential blowout and continued activities. These actions—the Onsite Supervisor indicating that
they were fine and the worker continuing activities after seeing gas venting from the well—indicate that
working around a well in the presence of gas was a normal condition at the Wendland 1-H well.
Based on the CSB’s review of the Wendland 1-H well’s workover history under multiple operators, the CSB
concludes that working in the presence of gas during workover operations was a common practice. The CSB
further concludes that this practice may have been normalized as a result of API RP 59 language that allows
operators to consider flow potential rather than stipulate the recommendation for a two-barrier-to-flow system,
Page 47

Investigation Report
and that API RP 59’s language regarding the consideration of a two-barriers-to-flow system does not provide
adequate guidance to companies operating underpressured wells.
The CSB recommends that API publish the following information in an appropriate document such as API RP
59 Recommended Practice for Well Control Operations:
1. A focused discussion on practices applicable to workover operations, including completed wells in
underpressured reservoirs. Include well control methods applicable to workover operations, such as
using continuous fluid addition, viscous fluids, bridging solids, and mechanical plugs. Also include a
discussion on the well control challenges and hazards specific to workover operations;
2. Stabbing valves should not be considered as well control barriers for workover operations; and
3. Every well should be considered to have potential to flow, and therefore, should have two well control
barriers, one of which should be a preventative barrier.
Page 48

Investigation Report
4.3 IGNITION SOURCE MANAGEMENT
API RP 500, Recommended Practice for Classification of Locations for Electrical Installations at Petroleum
Facilities Classified as Class I, Division 1 and Division 2, defines a hazardous or classified location as a
location where fire or explosion hazards may occur due to flammable gases or liquids. The API provides
examples of classified areas at petroleum facilities based on the equipment present in the areas. Figure 28
provides examples of the classification diagrams for various pieces of equipment. Class 1 areas are classified
based on the presence of flammable gases or vapors. The classification is further categorized by divisions.
Division 1 locations are those where the concentration of flammable gases is expected under normal conditions.
Division 2 locations are those where the concentration of flammable gases may be present but can be prevented
from accumulating using ventilation [28].
Figure 28: Examples of classified areas in API RP 500 (Credit: API)
These classified areas are critical in identifying the areas in which flammable gases can be present and can be
the basis for siting potential ignition sources.
4.3.1 POTENTIAL IGNITION SOURCES
At the time of the blowout, a mixture of flammable hydrocarbons (oil and gas) was released from the well. Due
to the pressure from the blowout, the flammable hydrocarbons were released rapidly, forming a vapor cloud,
which found an ignition source. Multiple potential ignition sources were identified in the vicinity of the open
wellbore. These included, but are not limited to:
• Static electricity
Page 49

Investigation Report
• Workover rig
• Hot oil truck
• Eagle truck
• Diesel-powered generator on Eagle trailer
• Forklift
• Hand tools
• Electric hydraulic pump (power pack) with extension cord
• Handheld controller for the torque wrench
Figure 29 shows an overhead view of the well following the incident with a number of potential ignition
sources and their respective distance from the well. Figure 29 also shows that the workover rig, the Eagle truck
and trailer, the forklift, and the hot oil truck sustained fire damage.

The power pack, extension cord, and handheld remote controller were located approximately 10 feet from the
wellbore (Figure 30), all of which appeared to have sustained fire damage.

CSB)
Given the multiple release points shown in Figure 17 and the dynamic nature of the release, the CSB was
unable to identify the exact ignition source.
4.3.2 INSUFFICIENT RISK ASSESSMENT
Chesapeake’s Contractor Health, Safety, Environmental, and Regulatory Handbook discusses the location of
ignition sources, specifically regarding hot worka and the use of lower explosive limit (LEL) monitoring. The
Handbook requires a hot work permit when performing, among other things, activities that use spark producing
power tools within 35 feet of any potential flammable sources. The Handbook also states that internal
combustion engines require “continuous atmospheric monitoring when operating within 35 feet of any potential
flammable atmosphere.” Although the Handbook discusses hand tools, it does not require that contractors use

Investigation Report
non-sparking tools. Further, the Handbook does not contain any stipulations regarding the placement of potential
ignition sources within or near classified areas as defined by API RP 500.
Chesapeake’s Job Safety Analysis (JSA) form, which was used by its contractors as a checklist for identifying
the hazards associated with the workover on the day of the incident, includes “Ignition Sources” as a potential
hazard. The JSA form does not contain any requirements regarding the placement of ignition sources, however,
nor does it require ignition hazards to be assessed based on classified areas as defined by API RP 500.
API RP 54, Occupational Safety and Health for Oil and Gas Well Drilling and Servicing Operations, provides
several guidelines for performing assessments to determine the safe location of equipment from flammable and
combustible sources.
A risk assessment should be performed and communicated to the affected crew and other
personnel (as appropriate) that determines the appropriate safe location and distance from the
wellbore and other potential flammable and combustible sources, appropriate safety measures
for hot work, welding, and flame cutting operations, and the requirement for a written procedure
[29, p. 20].
Furthermore, API RP 54 recommends the following:
Area classifications determine the type of and maintenance requirements for electrical
equipment on drilling and well servicing rigs under normal operating conditions. When special
service operations are being performed, the recommendations for electrical installations under
the conditions of service should be followed [29, p. 27].
API RP 99, Flash Fire Risk Assessment for the Upstream Oil and Gas Industry, provides general guidance on
the identification of hazards that could result in flash fires. As part of the prevention of flash fires, the control of
ignition sources is listed to reduce the risk of flash fires. API RP 99 also provides examples of the electrical
hazardous area classifications, which are examples from API RP 500, for electrical equipment with several
orientations of equipment.
API RP 99 further provides general guidance for risk assessments to prevent flash fires, using as an example a
bow-tie analysis, which highlights the need to control the ignition source location in proximity to a fuel source
to prevent flash fire hazards [30, p. 15].
According to a report prepared for Chesapeake,a the power pack used to bolt the tubing head was not
intrinsically safe, but Eagle workers believed that the equipment was intrinsically safe. OSHA has specified in
29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.307, Hazardous (Classified) Locations, the requirements for

4.4 FEDERAL REGULATORY SAFETY REQUIREMENTS
In conjunction with several of its proposed and final rulemakings, OSHA has historically stated that onshore oil
and gas drilling and servicinga operations should be regulated under a standard specific to that industry. On
December 28, 1983, OSHA issued a proposed rulemaking under 29 CFR 1910.270 to create requirements for
the oil and gas well drilling and servicing industry, entitled “Oil and Gas Well Drilling and Servicing.”b In the
preamble to the proposed rule, OSHA stated that “[w]orkers in the oil and gas well drilling and servicing
industry are exposed to a number of hazards associated with both the equipment and various operations
performed during the course of drilling or servicing” and that this industry “has many unique hazards or special
work circumstances which require special standards.” Despite the need for such a standard, OSHA never
finalized the proposed regulation [32].
4.4.1 CONTROL OF HAZARDOUS ENERGY
In the preamble to OSHA’s final rule establishing its Control of Hazardous Energy standard in September 1989,
OSHA stated that it excluded oil and gas well drilling and servicing operations from the standardc because the
agency had already undertaken rulemaking with regard to these activities (48 Fed. Reg. 57202) and because
OSHA believed at that time that oil and gas well drilling and servicing operations should be covered by a
standard designed to address the unique nature of that industry.d The Control of Hazardous Energy standard
exemption for oil and gas well drilling and servicing operations still exists today, although, as noted above,
OSHA has never issued a rule specifically addressing oil and gas well drilling and servicing operations.e
The Control of Hazardous Energy standard “covers the servicing and maintenance of…equipment in which the
unexpected…release of stored energy could cause injury to employees” [33]. As noted, however, the standard
specifically exempts oil and gas well drilling and servicing activities [33].
Well control can be defined as preventing formation fluids from entering the wellbore or stopping the well from
flowing if fluids do enter the wellbore [34]. Well control principles can also be described as preventing the
release of stored energy, consistent with the scope of OSHA’s Control of Hazardous Energy standard,
considering that formation fluids are under pressure.
a
Historically, OSHA has defined “oil well drilling and servicing” as covering “activities related to the initial drilling of a well and later,
maintenance work necessary to maintain or enhance production. Normally, such operations are occurring if a drilling rig or truck-
mounted rig or mast is present on the well. Oil well drilling and servicing includes the following activities: 1. The actual drilling and
associated activities of the well. 2. Well completion activities (i.e., activities and methods necessary to prepare a well for the production
of oil and gas). 3. Well servicing (i.e., the maintenance work performed on an oil or gas well to improve or maintain the production
from a formation already producing. Usually, it involves repairs to the pump, rods, gas-lift valves, tubing, packers and so forth). 4.
Workover activities (i.e., the performance of one or more of a variety of remedial operations on a producing oil well to try to increase
production. Examples of operations include deepening, plugging back, pulling and resetting liners, squeeze cementing, and so on.”

According to the Federal Register, OSHA withdrew its consideration of an oil and gas drilling and well servicing standard on August

Page 54

Investigation Report
Following the Wendland 1-H well incident, on July 28, 2020, OSHA issued citations to Chesapeake, Eagle, and
Forbes for not maintaining well control. Section 5(a)(1) of the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act of
1970, also known as the General Duty Clause, requires companies to provide a workplace “free from recognized
hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to…employees” [35]. The General
Duty Clause is not instructive regarding requirements for the control of hazardous energy for oil and gas drilling
and well servicing activities, however, and therefore, lacks sufficient warning to employers to prevent incidents.
Table 2 below outlines sections of the Control of Hazardous Energy standard and how, if applied to the
Wendland 1-H well, it may have prevented the incident from occurring.

The CSB believes that well control principles (i.e., preventing the release of stored energy) are equivalent to
controlling hazardous energy. Therefore, the CSB concludes that had more defined OSHA direction to oil and
gas companies been in place -- such as including oil and gas drilling, well servicing, production, and workover
operations in OHSA’s Control of Hazardous Energy standard -- Chesapeake and its contractors may have taken
greater measures to ensure positive well control was maintained throughout its operation, thereby preventing the
incident from occurring.
The CSB recommends that OSHA remove the exemption for oil and gas drilling and well servicing from the
Control of Hazardous Energy standard (29 CFR 1910.147) and expand its application to cover oil and gas
production and workover operations.
4.4.2 PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT
OSHA also has exempted oil and gas drilling and servicing from the Process Safety Management of highly
hazardous chemicals (PSM) standard.
In OSHA’s preamble to its final rule for the PSM standard, which was adopted in 1992, OSHA stated that it
excluded oil and gas well drilling and servicing operations because the agency had already undertaken a
rulemaking regarding these activities (48 Fed. Reg. 57202). The PSM standard exemption for oil and gas well
drilling and servicing operations still exists today, although, as noted, OSHA has never finalized a rule
specifically addressing these operations.
OSHA addressed the issue of regulating oil and gas drilling and servicing once again in 2013, following
President Obama’s Executive Order (EO) 13650, Improving Chemical Facility Safety and Security. Section
6(e)(ii) of EO 13650 required OSHA to publish, within 90 days, a Request for Information (RFI) designed to
identify issues related to modernization of its PSM standard and other related standards needed to meet the
stated goal of preventing major chemical accidents.
OSHA published a RFI on December 9, 2013, on potential revisions to several agency standards, including the
PSM standard. With regard to oil and gas well drilling and servicing, the agency stated:
Paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of § 1910.119 exempts oil- and gas-well drilling and
servicing operations from PSM coverage. The preamble to the PSM final rule
explained that OSHA excluded these operations because it had begun a separate
rulemaking for oil and gas well drilling and servicing operations (48 FR
57202). However, the Agency subsequently removed the oil and gas well
drilling and servicing operations rulemaking from its regulatory agenda and
never promulgated a final rule for these operations. In light of this history,
Page 56

Investigation Report
OSHA requests public comment on whether to retain or remove the §
1910.119(a)(2)(ii) exemption.a
The CSB submitted a response to the RFI on March 31, 2014. In its comments, the CSB specifically provided
input on changes needed for the regulation of oil and gas well drilling and servicing operations. The CSB stated
that it had identified 1,285 incidents between 2009 and February 2014, resulting in a serious injury, a fatality to
a worker, an evacuation or a shelter in place of more than 500 residents; a facility impact of more than
$500,000; and/or significant environmental damage. One-hundred-three (103) – or eight percent -- of these
incidents occurred in the oil and gas sector. The CSB also stated that it had encountered numerous hot work
activities where explosions and fires occurred from the ignition of flammable vapors in a confined area, such as
a tank, typically during maintenance. As renowned process safety expert Dr. Trever Kletz noted: “Errors in the
preparation of equipment for maintenance are one of the commonest causes of serious accidents in the chemical
and allied industries” [36, p. 807]. Based on the high rate of worker injuries and fatalities within these sectors,
the CSB urged OSHA to eliminate the PSM exemption for oil and gas well drilling and servicing. The CSB
believed then, and still believes, that making all of -- or at least the most pertinent parts of -- the PSM standard
applicable to these industries would significantly improve safety and better protect workers far more than
citations for General Duty Clause violations.
The activities at the Wendland 1-H well at the time of the incident were not regulated by OSHA’s PSM
standard. However, had Chesapeake developed and implemented a safety management system, such as that
required under OSHA’s PSM standard, specifically for workovers, the incident might not have occurred. Table
3 outlines requirements from OSHA’s PSM standard that, if applied to the Wendland 1-H well at the time of the
incident, might have prevented the incident from occurring.

The CSB concludes that had Chesapeake been required to maintain Process Safety Information (PSI), as defined
in Table 3, utilized that PSI to evaluate the hazards (working over an open well that is venting flammable gas to
atmosphere in the presence of multiple ignition sources) of the workover, and utilized that hazard evaluation to
write detailed specific procedures to conduct all workover and servicing operations, the incident may not have
occurred. Furthermore, a performance standard, similar to the OSHA PSM standard, would have required
Chesapeake and its contractors to develop policies and procedures that could have prevented the incident.
4.4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR FEDERAL REGULATION
A federal standard tailored to the unique hazards of the oil and gas drilling and servicing, production and
workover industries could drive positive safety change. In the years since OSHA’s initial proposal and
subsequent removal of the oil and gas drilling and serving rulemaking, there have been lessons learned from
more recent incidents and continued development of good industry practice guidelines.
OSHA’s Onshore Oil and Gas SEPs
OSHA’s special emphasis programs (SEPs) provide a framework for the agency to do outreach and conduct
programmed inspections in industries with potentially high injury or illness rates. The oil and gas industry
involves many hazards, including working with high pressure oil and gas systems, working in hazardous
Page 59

Investigation Report
locations with explosive concentrations of hydrocarbons, and the potential for high exposures to hydrogen
sulfide, and/or other health hazards.a
OSHA’s regional offices in Regions III, VI, and VIII have been conducting targeted inspections of oil and gas
worksites since at least 2010, under SEPs (referred to as Regional Emphasis Programs – REPs) (see Table 4)b
Table 4. OSHA regions conducting targeted inspections. (Credit: CSB)
Region Affected Areas
III District of Columbia, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia
VI Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas
VIII Colorado, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, and Utah
The Wendland 1-H Well is located in Texas, which is in OSHA Region VI. During FY 2019, Region VI
conducted 2,017 inspections for activitiesc such as, but not limited to, drilling, exploration, workover, and
servicing. Region VI also investigated 19 fatal injuries and 35 employer-reported referrals during FY 2019
alone, under its REP. Region VI noted that explosion and fire hazards are among the leading causes of death
within the oil and gas industry. Region VI also has stated:d
Since OSHA has no national program dealing with this industry, a regional
emphasis program is necessary to address the fatalities/catastrophes and
severe injuries and illness occurring within this jurisdiction.
Pryor Trust incident
The CSB investigated the gas well blowout and fire at the Pryor Trust well in Pittsburg County, Oklahoma in
January 2018. This incident occurred during drilling operations, which are exempt from OSHA regulations.
The Pryor Trust incident involved multiple safety issues similar to the safety issues discussed in this report for
the Wendland 1-H well blowout, such as: poor barrier management, lack of adequate procedures, and lack of
safety regulation requirements. From the Pryor Trust investigation, the CSB issued the following
recommendation to OSHA:
Implement one of the three following options regarding regulatory changes:

Investigation Report
(a) OPTION 1: Apply the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR
1910.119) to the drilling of oil and gas wells; or
(b) OPTION 2: Apply the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR
1910.119) to the drilling of oil and gas wells as in OPTION 1, and make the
necessary modifications to customize it to oil and gas drilling operations; or
(c) OPTION 3: Develop a new standard with a safety management system
framework similar to PSM that applies only to the drilling of onshore oil and
gas wells that includes but is not limited to the following:
1) Detailed written operating procedures with specified steps and
equipment alignment for all operations;
2) Written procedures for the management of changes (except
replacements in kind) in procedures, the well plan, and equipment;
3) A risk assessment of hazards associated with the drilling plan;
4) A requirement to follow Recognized and Generally Accepted Good
Engineering Practices (RAGAGEP);
5) Development of a Well Construction Interface Document between the
operator and the drilling contractor prior to the commencement of
drilling activities which at a minimum includes a bridging document
and well plan specifying barriers and how to manage them;
6) The performance and documentation of flow checks using acceptable
methods at defined points during the operation for a specified duration;
and
7) A requirement for employee participation, similar to the Employee
Participation requirement in the OSHA PSM standard.
This recommendation to OSHA remains open.
The CSB concludes that while the Pryor Trust incident was a result of drilling operations, which is not the same
as the workover operations that were ongoing during the Wendland incident, it underscores the need for federal
regulations for the onshore oil and gas industry.
Federal Onshore Oil and Gas Regulation
OSHA can begin rulemaking for several reasons, including injuries and illnesses affecting workersa. The first
step of the OSHA rulemaking process involves the identification of serious safety or health hazards. After these
hazards are identified, data are gathered to determine the scope of the problem and determine the information
a
https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/rulemakingprocess#v-nav-tab0
Page 61

Investigation Report
needed for further analyses including health effects assessment, risk assessment, technological feasibility
analysis, and economic analysis.a The information previously gathered by OSHA in the agency’s original
rulemaking proposal, combined with the information gathered through SEPs, can be used to support a
rulemaking effort now.
The CSB concludes that an industry-specific federal standard for the oil and gas industry, incorporating the
lessons learned and information gathered from SEPs and the CSB’s investigation reports on the Pryor Trust
Fatal Gas Well Blowout and Fire and this investigation report, is necessary.
Therefore, the CSB supersedes CSB Recommendation No. 2018-01-I-OK-R1 from the Pryor Trust Fatal Gas
Well Blowout and Fire report and recommends that OSHA promulgate a new standard with prescriptive
requirements, similar to the Control of Hazardous Energy standard, as well as a performance-based safety
management system framework, similar to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM), that applies to the
drilling, production, and servicing/workover activities surrounding onshore oil and gas wells. At a minimum,
this standard should include the following:
1. Prescriptively address requirements for primary and secondary barriers for well control;
2. Detailed written drilling, production, and servicing procedures with specified steps and equipment
alignment for all operations;
3. Management of change requirements (except replacements in kind) that, at a minimum, address
procedures, the well plan, and equipment;
4. A risk assessment of hazards associated with the drilling, production, and servicing/workover plans;
5. A requirement to follow Recognized and Generally Accepted Good Engineering Practices
(RAGAGEP);
6. Development of a Well Construction Interface Document between the operator and the drilling
contractor prior to the commencement of drilling and servicing activities and an equivalent document
for production and workover contractors which, at a minimum, includes a bridging document and well
plans specifying barriers and how to manage them;
7. The performance and documentation of flow checks using acceptable methods at defined points during
the operation for a specified duration;
8. A requirement for employee participation, similar to the Employee Participation requirement in the
OSHA PSM standard;
9. A requirement for maintaining critical well information, similar to the Process Safety Information
requirement in the OSHA PSM standard, which at a minimum includes well history and documented
well control methods during workovers;
a

10. A requirement for analyzing and assessing the hazards during all phases and steps for well servicing,
similar to the Process Hazard Analysis requirement in the OSHA PSM standard;
11. A requirement for developing, executing, communicating, and maintaining procedures for drilling,
production, and servicing operations on a well, similar to the Operating Procedures requirement in the
OSHA PSM standard; and
12. The documentation of well control plans for drilling, production, and servicing/workover operations for
a well utilizing acceptable methods for monitoring the effectiveness of well control methods.
Page 63

Investigation Report
5 CONCLUSIONS
5.1 FINDINGS
1. Based on shut-in pressures observed before and after the incident, the well blowout occurred as a result of
both a loss of fluid overbalance and a change in the reservoir conditions, allowing oil and gas to flow to the
surface.
2. A review of the well history, as recommended by API RP 59, would have revealed past instances where the
Wendland 1-H well could flow oil during a workover. Such recognition may have led to heightened
awareness of the potential for well control problems and earlier action taken to maintain well control.
3. Chesapeake did not provide written operating or contingency procedures for establishing and maintaining
well control. Had Chesapeake and its contractors performed well planning in accordance with API RP 59,
an operating procedure describing the instructions for establishing and maintaining well control would have
been prepared and posted for use by contractors performing the workover operations.
4. Chesapeake failed to provide effective well control guidance, and Chesapeake’s contractors failed to
maintain an effective hydrostatic barrier because Chesapeake’s Barrier Policy did not incorporate
appropriate methods for maintaining a hydrostatic barrier for a completed well in an underpressured
reservoir.
5. The use of open surface valves and stabbing valves as a well control barrier is not effective since it (1) is a
mitigative control actuated after the release begins and (2) increases the risks to workers in the event of a
release by creating a flammable vapor cloud around them with potential ignition sources nearby.
6. Present API guidance for well control involving completed wells in underpressured reservoirs is not
adequate for the implementation of an effective hydrostatic barrier. Had more robust guidance been
presented in API RP 59, Chesapeake may have instituted more effective well control practices, potentially
preventing the incident from occurring.
7. Working in the presence of gas during workover operations was a common practice. This practice may have
been normalized as a result of API RP 59 language that allows operators to consider flow potential rather
than stipulate the recommendation for a two-barrier-to-flow system, and that API RP 59 language regarding
the consideration of a two-barriers-to-flow system does not provide adequate guidance to companies
operating underpressured wells.
8. Chesapeake’s contractors neither evaluated the potential classified locations nor adequately controlled the
siting of ignition sources that were in proximity to the open wellbore resulting in the ignition of the
flammable gas mixture following the blowout of the well. Had Chesapeake’s contractors assessed the
classified areas and the associated siting of potential ignition sources, the flammable gases released during
the blowout could have been prevented from igniting, and the incident could have been prevented.
9. OSHA currently exempts oil and gas well servicing activities from its Control of Hazardous Energy
standard. Had more defined OSHA direction to oil and gas companies been in place -- such as including oil
and gas drilling, well servicing, production, and workover operations in OSHA’s Control of Hazardous
Page 64

Investigation Report
Energy standard -- Chesapeake and its contractors may have taken greater measures to ensure positive well
control was maintained throughout its operation, thereby preventing the incident from occurring.
10. Had Chesapeake been required to maintain Process Safety Information (PSI), utilized that PSI to evaluate
the hazards (working over an open well venting flammable gas to atmosphere in the presence of multiple
ignition sources) of the workover, and utilized that hazard evaluation to write detailed specific procedures to
conduct all workover and servicing operations, the incident may not have occurred.
11. While the Pryor Trust incident was a result of drilling operations, which is not the same as the workover
operations that were ongoing during the Wendland incident, it underscores the need for federal regulations
for the onshore oil and gas industry. A performance standard, similar to the OSHA PSM standard, would
have required Chesapeake and its contractors to develop policies and procedures that could have prevented
the incident.
12. An industry-specific federal standard for the oil and gas industry, incorporating the lessons learned and
information gathered from SEPs and the CSB’s investigation report on the Pryor Trust Fatal Gas Well
Blowout and Fire and this investigation report, is necessary.
5.2 CAUSE
The CSB determined that the cause of the Wendland 1-H well blowout was the lack of well planning regarding
the implementation of well control. Insufficient industry guidance regarding well control for completed wells in
underpressured reservoirs contributed to the blowout, resulting in ineffective well control practices for these
types of wells. The attempted well control barriers were ineffective, resulting in the release of hydrocarbons that
ignited upon finding an ignition source.
The CSB also determined that ineffective ignition source management contributed to the fire, resulting in three
fatal injuries and one serious injury. The absence of regulations governing onshore oil and gas operations
contributed to the incident, resulting in the failure to both effectively control hazardous energy and implement
essential risk assessments that could have prevented this incident.

Investigation Report
7 KEY LESSONS FOR THE INDUSTRY
To prevent future chemical incidents, and in the interest of driving chemical safety excellence to protect
communities, workers, and the environment, the CSB urges companies to review these key lessons:
1. To successfully execute well control, proper well planning is required. Industry guidance recommends
gathering well information, evaluating potential hazards based on that information, and creating
operating procedures and contingency plans to address those hazards. Companies should incorporate
well planning, based on industry guidance, into their well control policies and procedures.
2. Despite having substantial industry guidance regarding how companies should conduct well control,
industry guidance is lacking regarding specific well control methods for completed wells in
underpressured reservoirs. Companies that operate these types of wells need to be aware of this gap and
use necessary resources, such as other recognized technical literature, such as Well Control for
Completions and Interventions by H. Crumpton, when creating well control policies and procedures for
workovers.
3. All phases of well operations, including workovers, can involve potential ignition sources, some of
which cannot be eliminated. To mitigate the potential for the ignition of flammable material at well
sites, companies should incorporate ignition source risk assessments into their policies and adhere to
industry guidance and regulations on ignition source placement, including the use of properly rated
equipment.

APPENDIX B—CALCULATIONS
Change in Wellbore Fluid Level
Upon opening the well to atmosphere on January 29, 2020, the static head pressure at the top of the wellbore
went from 50 psig to zero psig (atmospheric). As a result, the liquid level in the wellbore would have risen the
amount in feet equivalent to 50 psig, based on the following equation:
, (1)
ℎwh=ere 𝑃𝑃h i/s 𝐺𝐺th e amount of fluid increase in feet, P is the pressure change in psig, and G is the pressure gradient in
psig per foot of the liquid column. Reducing the static head pressure at the top of the wellbore resulted in an
increase in the height of the fluid column of 171 feet, bringing the estimated liquid level from 4,850 feet to
4,679 feet below the surface.
Upon pumping 50 bbls of 10-ppg brine into the well, assuming the brine addition was instantaneous, the
increase in the liquid level would have been based on the capacity of the production casing. The result was
calculated for a seven-inch, 23 pounds-per-foot casing using the following:
, (2)
ℎwh=ere𝑉𝑉 V/ r𝐶𝐶epresents the volume of additional fluid in barrels and C is the volumetric capacity of the casing. The
addition of 50 bbls of brine, based on a given casing capacity of 0.03937 bbls per foot, added an additional
1,270 feet of fluid into the well. Based on the brine density of 10 pounds per gallon, the additional fluid resulted
in a hydrostatic pressure overbalance, using Equation (1) and a brine fluid gradient of 0.52 psi per foot,a of 661
psig.
Rate of Fluid Loss into the Reservoir
Darcy’s radial inflow calculation is normally used in petroleum engineering to estimate the flow potential into a
well [37]. Crumpton used the equation to estimate the rate of fluid loss into the reservoir [14, pp. 208-209]. The
fluid loss rate from the wellbore can be estimated using the following equation [10]:

based on the initial bottom hole pressure (820 psig) plus the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid column added. The
initial added fluid column was 1,270 feet which added 661 psig of fluid head pressure. Thus, the initial
bottomhole pressure was 1,481 psig (661 psig plus 1,270 psig). The fluid loss rate gradually decreases as fluid is
lost from the wellbore to the formation. As a simplifying assumption, the height used for the fluid loss

Fluid gradient in psi per foot is obtained by multiplying the fluid density in ppg by 0.052.

calculation was based on the midpoint between the initial added fluid column height, 1,270 feet, or 661 psig, and
the point where the added fluid is completely lost to the reservoir. The pressure associated with that midpoint is
330 psig. Therefore, the value used for the fluid hydrostatic pressure in the calculation was 1,150 psig, which is
820 psig plus 330 psig.

1 Permeability was estimated based on a typical value for the Austin Chalk [38, p. 6].
2 This value was obtained by adding the initial reservoir pressure to the hydrostatic pressure of the added brine calculated
earlier using Eq. (2).
3 Brine viscosity was obtained from published tabular data, assuming a reservoir temperature of 200°F and use of a single-
salt (sodium) formate brine [37, p. 5].
4 Formation volume factor was calculated using the Standing correlation, assuming a range of gas-to-oil ratios from 2100-
7300, oil specific gravity of 0.80, and gas specific gravity of 0.65 [39, p. 105].
5 Drainage radius was estimated to 0.65% of original reservoir oil saturation [38, pp. 12-13].
6 A skin factor of zero assumes ideal pressure drop conditions across the boundary between the wellbore and the reservoir
[40].

Investigation Report
Based on the variables listed in Table 5, the CSB calculated an estimated fluid loss rate from the wellbore of 15
to 40 bbl/hr. Based on these results, a 50 bbl batch load of brine or fresh water would flow into the formation
within 1.3 to 3.5 hours after placing the fluid in the wellbore. The reservoir temperature of 200°F is likely more
reflective of conditions at the point where heavier brine fluid is lost to the formation.
To illustrate the effectiveness of a higher viscosity fluid addition, the CSB also calculated a hypothetical fluid
loss rate using a polymer with a viscosity of 200 cP. Using the same variables and assumptions, the fluid loss
rate using a polymer was 0.04 to 0.11 bbls/hr.

Investigation Report
APPENDIX C—WELL WORKOVER HISTORY
The CSB reviewed the workover history of the Wendland 1-H well. Records from 34 well workovers since 1993
were provided to the CSB. During the 34 well workovers, the well routinely relieved gas. Well control events
were reported as: “well came in,” “heavy gas”, “blowing strong,” “well flowing,” “well started to flow,” etc.
Most events reference relieving gas. These types of well control events were reported 22 times during the 34
workovers. Some workovers had multiple reported events.
The fluid was typically loaded into the wellbore as a single batch, averaging about 50 bbls each time. Based on
review of the records, the barrier philosophy appeared to be: 1) pumping a single volume of clear fluids as a
primary barrier and 2) usage of a stabbing valve as the secondary barrier.
On three 1995 workovers, the fluid was continuously added to the well. During the first two workovers, one in
April and one in May, continuous fluid addition did not prevent well control events. These records also did not
contain the flow rate at which fluid was added. During the June 1995 workover, fluid was added continuously at
rates ranging from 0.75 to 1 bbl per minute. There were no well control events during the June 1995 workover.
In February 1996, the workover crew pumped 35 bbls of water initially. This fluid addition resulted in gas being
vented at the surface. The workover crew then pumped 70 bbls of water to stop the gas from coming up, but this
attempt was unsuccessful. The gas stopped only after the workover crew pumped two more batches of water at
70 bbls each, using a total of 245 bbls of water during this workover. This workover suggests that pumping
water into this well may have destabilized the well, resulting in multiple well control events requiring additional
volumes of fluid to be added.
