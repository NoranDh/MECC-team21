This mechanism is often present with other mechanisms such as oxygen corrosion, galvanic corrosion, and microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC). b) In chloride brine corrosion of stainless steels, pits are initiated where chlorides break down the passive layer. Once the pit is initiated, chlorides migrate within the pit, hydrolyze to an acidic species, decrease the pH in the pit, and further accelerate corrosion by this autocatalytic process. A similar process occurs in crevices. Additionally, other anions like nitrates and sulfates hydrolyze within pits and crevices to drive the pH down, but these are less mobile than chlorides so their effect is less significant.",

    "description": "a) This subject covers a wide range of situations of material loss, from flowing solid particles alone or in a liquid or vapor stream physically abrading the material to material loss accelerated by the flow of corrosive liquid or vapor possibly combined with the velocity-assisted removal of a protective film or scale. Erosion is the mechanical removal of surface material as the result of relative movement between, or impact from, solids, liquids, vapor, or any combination thereof. It is typically found in services where solids are entrained in liquid or vapor streams such as slurries and fluidized solids. In refining, with the exception of water droplets in steam systems, it is unlikely that any flowing liquid or liquid impingement (without entrained solids) would be able to erode typical materials of construction without there also being a corrosion component present. The same can be said for gases, with the possible exception of steam cutting. However, see Cavitation (3.16). Erosion-corrosion is a description for the damage that occurs when particle erosion and/or high flow velocity contributes to corrosion by removing protective films or scales or otherwise accelerating the corrosion rate. This is also called velocity-assisted corrosion. b) In most refinery erosion-corrosion situations, corrosion is the dominant consideration.",

    "critical_factors": [
      "a) With solid particle mechanical erosion, metal loss rates will depend on the velocity and number of impacting",

      "subject to severe metal loss under high-velocity conditions.",
      "Increasing the hardness of the eroding metal component can reduce the rate of erosion damage.",

      "solid particle mechanical erosion described in Item a). However, with the solid particles removing any",
      "protective scales or other protective barrier on the metal surface, the rate of metal loss can be much greater",
      "than what is normally seen from the corrosion mechanism alone.",
      "c) For corrosive liquid droplets entrained in a vapor, metal loss rates will depend on the velocity and number or",
      "rate of impacting droplets and the corrosivity of the liquid.",
      "d) Many corrosive liquid environments will exhibit velocity-accelerated corrosion. In some cases, there is a",
      "threshold velocity below which corrosion is minimal but above which corrosion becomes significant. In other",
      "cases, there is no specific threshold; the highest corrosion rates simply occur where the velocity is greatest.",

Extensive decarburization will reduce component strength. (See 3.25 for more on decarburization.) c) If diffusion of carbon to the surface is limited, CH is formed internally from internal decarburization. Internal 4 CH cannot diffuse through the steel. As a result, internal CH pressure builds up, initially forming bubbles or 4 4 cavities, then microfissures, and finally fissures that may combine to form cracks. Internal damage leading to cracking is the more serious effect of HTHA, and it can lead to equipment failure. d) Failure can occur when the cracks reduce the load (pressure) carrying ability of the pressure-containing part. e) Blistering may also occur due to either molecular hydrogen (from re-combined hydrogen atoms) or CH 4 accumulating in laminations or other conducive sites in the steel. f) See Reference 1 (API RP 941) for more detailed information on HTHA.",

    "description": "This section describes four types of damage that result in blistering and/or cracking of carbon steel, one of which also affects low-alloy steels and some other high-strength or hardenable materials, in wet H S environments. 2 a) Hydrogen Blistering Hydrogen blisters form bulges primarily on the ID surface of pressure vessels. Hydrogen blistering is rare in seamless pipe but can occur in seam-welded pipe. Blisters are caused by the hydrogen atoms that form on the surface of the steel as a result of corrosion reactions. Sulfur acts as a recombination poison, delaying the combining of hydrogen atoms into hydrogen gas molecules (H ), allowing the hydrogen atoms to linger on 2 the steel surface. The small hydrogen atoms can then readily diffuse into the steel. (This hydrogen charging effect applies to all types of wet H S damage.) The hydrogen atoms diffusing into the steel collect at 2 discontinuities such as inclusions or laminations, where they then combine to form H gas, because there is 2 no recombination poison within the steel to inhibit the reaction. The hydrogen gas molecules thus become trapped at the site because they are too large to diffuse away through the steel. As corrosion proceeds, hydrogen atoms continue to form on the surface and then diffuse into the steel to become trapped as H at 2 the collection sites, building the H gas pressure to the point where local deformation occurs, forming a blister. 2 Blistering only results from hydrogen generated by corrosion, not from hydrogen gas in the process stream. (See Figure 3-67-1 and Figure 3-67-2 for blistering damage.) HCN accentuates the problem by weakening protective films on the metal surface, thereby increasing the rate of corrosion. This in turn leads to increased hydrogen charging and associated wet H S damage. (This 2 also applies to all types of wet H S damage.) 2 b) Hydrogen-induced Cracking (HIC) HIC results from the same cause as blistering, i.e. from hydrogen atoms diffusing into the steel as a result of corrosion. However, in this case, when the hydrogen atoms diffuse into the steel, rather than forming blisters, internal separations parallel to the surface of the steel result. Again, it is the pressure buildup resulting from hydrogen atoms combining to form H gas that cause the internal separations within the wall of the vessel. 2 The separations are initially microscopic in size but can connect together to form macroscopic-sized cracks, by growing into one large separation on the same plane parallel to the surface or more commonly by linking up with HIC on different planes (at different depths into the wall), eventually forming a thru-wall leak path. Interconnecting cracks between HIC separations on different planes have a stair step appearance, and so HIC is sometimes referred to as “stepwise cracking.” (See Figure 3-67-3 to Figure 3-67-5 for HIC damage.) c) Stress-oriented Hydrogen-induced Cracking (SOHIC) SOHIC results from an array of HIC (separations or cracks) stacked on top of each other. When acted upon by a high stress level (residual or applied), the stacked HIC will connect and create a thru-thickness crack that is perpendicular to the surface. SOHIC most often occurs in the base metal adjacent to weld HAZs, the residual stress from welding being the most common driver of SOHIC. SOHIC can initiate from the stacked HIC alone, from sulfide stress cracks, or from other crack-like defects or stress concentrations. SOHIC is a potentially more damaging form of cracking than HIC because of its relatively higher rate of developing a thru-wall crack. In addition, an absence of visual blistering may leave a false sense of security that H S 2 damage is not active, yet subsurface SOHIC may be present. (See Figure 3-67-6 to Figure 3-67-8 for SOHIC damage.) d) Sulfide Stress Cracking (SCC) SSC is the cracking of a susceptible metal under the combined action of tensile stress and corrosion in the presence of water and H S. SSC is a form of HE cracking (see 3.40) resulting from absorption of atomic 2 hydrogen that is produced on the metal surface by the corrosion process. In addition to carbon steel and low- alloy steels, martensitic stainless steels such as Type 410 are also susceptible if hardness is not controlled to a low enough level. DAMAGE MECHANISMS AFFECTING FIXED EQUIPMENT IN THE REFINING INDUSTRY 335 SSC occurs in high-strength (high-hardness) steels but can also initiate in highly localized zones of high hardness in weld metal and HAZs. While SSC is uncommon in modern (post-1980) steels, zones of high hardness can sometimes be found in weld cover passes and attachment welds that are not tempered (softened) by subsequent passes. PWHT is beneficial in reducing the high hardness and residual stresses that render steel susceptible to SSC and is essential when welding hardenable low-alloy steels including Cr- Mo steels, as well as martensitic stainless steels. Some carbon steels contain REs that form hard areas in the HAZ that will not temper at normal stress-relieving temperatures. Using preheat helps minimize these hardness problems. While high-strength steels are susceptible to SSC, they are only used in limited applications such as valve internals and similar internal components in the refining industry. Hard welds and hard spots within otherwise soft welds can arise with SAW when an active flux is used along with high welding voltage. This high hardness can lead to SSC. (See Reference 9.) The time to failure by SSC decreases as the steel strength, level of tensile stress, and hydrogen charging potential of the environment increase. (See Figure 3-67-9 and Figure 3-67-10 for SSC damage.)",
