Of the 15 petroleum refineries\noperating in California as of October 2012, 11 of those were unionized, with USW providing the union\nrepresentation at all 11 facilities.\n471 For complete statistics on trade union density for countries around the world see\nhttp://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?QueryId=20167 (accessed September 5, 2013).\n472 HSE.

Has the safety case regulatory approach resulted in fewer major accidents?\nThe CSB has identified a small number of independent studies conducted on the impact of the safety case\nregulatory approach on safety performance onshore and offshore. In 1999, a report commissioned by the\nHSE ( the Aberdeen Report ) which evaluated the impact of the offshore Safety Case Regulations on\noffshore safety was published.476 One of the purposes of the study was to review published safety data\nfor trends in offshore accidents and incidents from 1990 until 1997.477 Upon this review, it was\ndetermined there had been a decrease in accidents since the implementation of the offshore safety case\nregulations in the UK, but cautioned it was difficult to distinguish the effect of the safety case regulations\nfrom other industry activities such as the level and type of exploration and production activity, oil prices,\nand industry-led initiatives.478 The Aberdeen Report also cautioned about the difficulties in analyzing\noffshore data that also hold true for the more current data presented in Figure 3. The total number of\naccidents and incidents recorded can be affected by industry attitudes toward reporting, changes in how\nand what data is reported, and the decrease or increase in offshore activity.

Houses were damaged as far as three-quarters of a mile away from the refinery. In a 2006\nstatement, former CSB Chairwoman Carolyn Merritt said that while BP did make some safety\nimprovements before the March 2005 explosion,  the focus of many of these initiatives was on improving\nprocedural compliance and reducing occupational injury rates, while catastrophic safety risks\nremained . 24\nIn November 2009, an ex",
