Inc. Refinery in Richmond, California, (“the Chevron Richmond\nRefinery”) experienced a catastrophic pipe failure in the #4 Crude Unit (“the crude unit”). The pipe, a 52-\ninch long carbon steel piping component of the #4 sidecut line, ruptured and released flammable,\nhydrocarbon process fluid, which partially vaporized into a large vapor cloud that engulfed 19 Chevron\nemployees and ignited. All of the employees escaped, narrowly avoiding serious injury. The ignition of\nthe flammable portion of the vapor cloud and subsequent continued burning of the hydrocarbon process\nfluid resulted in a large plume of particulates and vapor traveling across the Richmond, California area.\nApproximately 15,000 people from the surrounding area sought medical treatment due to the release.\n1.2 Interim Report\nThe CSB released an Interim Report on the Chevron incident in April 2013 (“the Interim Report”), which\nhighlighted technical findings and safety system deficiencies. Testing conducted on the ruptured pipe\ndetermined that it had experienced extreme thinning near the rupture location due to sulfidation\ncorrosion.1 Sulfidation corrosion is a damage mechanism that causes thinning in iron-containing\nmaterials, such as steel, due to the reaction between sulfur compounds and iron at temperatures ranging\nfrom 450 °F to 800 °F.2 This damage mechanism3 causes pipe walls to gradually thin over time, and is\ncommon in crude oil distillation4 where naturally occurring sulfur and sulfur compounds found in crude\noil feed, such as hydrogen sulfide,5 are available to react with steel piping and equipment. The Interim\nReport stated that virtually all crude oil feeds contain sulfur compounds and, as a result, sulfidation\ncorrosion is a damage mechanism present at every refinery that processes crude oil. Sulfidation corrosion\ncan cause thinning to the point of pipe failure when not properly monitored and controlled.\nThe Interim Report noted a number of causal safety system deficiencies that highlight regulatory gaps\nrelating to major accident prevention at California petroleum refineries. For example, in conducting its\nprocess hazard analysis\n6\n(PHA) of the crude unit, which was required under California’s Process Safety\n1 With respect to the sulfidation corrosion damage mechanism that caused the Chevron incident, carbon steel piping\ncorrodes at a rate that is significantly faster than other materials of construction, such as high chromium steels,\nincluding stainless steel.\n2 For an electronic copy of the CSB Chevron Interim Report see\nhttp://www.csb.gov/assets/1/19/Chevron_Interim_Report_Final_2013-04-17.pdf (accessed October 24. 2013).\n3 Piping damage mechanisms are any type of deterioration encountered in the refining and chemical process industry\nthat can result in flaws/defects that can affect the integrity of piping (e.g. corrosion, cracking, erosion, dents, and\nother mechanical, physical or chemical impacts). See API 570. \"Piping Inspection Code: In-Service Inspection,\nRating, Repair, and Alteration of Piping Systems.\" 3rd ed., Section 3.1.1.5, November 2009.\n4 Distillation separates mixtures into broad categories of its components by heating the mixture in a distillation\ncolumn where different products boil off and are recovered at different temperatures. See\nhttp://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=6970 (accessed April 4, 2013).\n5 Hydrogen sulfide is the most aggressive sulfur compound that causes sulfidation corrosion.\n6 A process hazard analysis (PHA) is a hazard evaluation to identify, evaluate, and control the hazards of a process.\nFacilities that process a threshold quantity of hazardous materials, such as the Chevron Richmond refinery, are\nrequired to conduct a process hazard analysis per the California Code of Regulations Title 8 Section 5189, Process\n7\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\nManagement (PSM) standard,7 Chevron did not conduct a rigorous review of corrosion and damage\nmechanisms present in the crude unit, and did not identify sulfidation corrosion as a hazard. As such,\nChevron did not effectively address inherent safety8 or implement effective controls to prevent sulfidation\ncorrosion, including those controls proposed by Chevron’s technical group. Although both the California\nand federal PSM standards require that hazards be identified, evaluated, and controlled, there is no further\ndiscussion of how far to reduce risks, and there is no requirement to address the effectiveness of controls\nor to use the hierarchy of controls.9 Therefore, this type of analysis was not required to be conducted, and\nChevron was never cited post-incident for failing to evaluate the effectiveness of safeguards.\nIn another example, despite internal recommendations to replace the entire #4 sidecut piping with an\ninherently safer, more corrosion-resistant material of construction through the Management of Change\n(MOC) process, incident investigations, technical reports, and employee recommendations, Chevron\nrepeatedly failed to implement those proposed recommendations. Chevron’s 2006 MOC analysis limited\napplication of those recommendations to only a small section of the pipe. As a result, the portion of the\npipe that failed on the August 6th incident remained in service until the incident. As there is no\nrequirement to implement effective recommendations or control hazards under the MOC element, it is\nessentially an activity-based requirement. Chevron was not cited for narrowing the scope of the MOC,\ndespite its disregard of internal recommendations. The CSB concluded in its Interim Report that Chevron\ndid not regularly or rigorously apply inherently safer technology, which provides an opportunity for\npreventing major accidents, in its PHAs, MOCs, incident investigation recommendations, or during\nturnarounds.\nThe CSB made safety recommendations in the Interim Report to a number of entities, including the\nCalifornia State Legislature, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and Contra Costa County. The\nBoard recommended that the California State Legislature require California petroleum refineries to\nperform damage mechanism hazard reviews, to identify and report leading and lagging process safety\nindicators, to document recognized methodologies, rationale, and conclusions used to claim that\nsafeguards intended to control hazards will be effective, and to document their inherently safer systems\nanalysis and the hierarchy of controls in establishing safeguards for process hazards, with the goal of\ndriving risk of major accidents to as low as reasonably practicable, or ALARP. These concepts,\nintroduced in the Interim Report and highlighted in the recommendations, are the basic building blocks\nfor the implementation of the safety case regime, a regulatory scheme that will be discussed in great detail\nin the following report.\nThe CSB concluded its Interim Report by highlighting additional issues that were still under\ninvestigation, including emergency planning and reporting, emergency response, safety culture, and\nregulatory oversight of petroleum refineries in California. The following report fulfills the CSB’s\nSafety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials (1992). PHAs are also required by the California Accidental\nRelease Prevention Program and the federal EPA Risk Management Program.\n7 Under 8 CCR §5189 (e). https://www.dir.ca.gov/title8/5189.html (accessed September 25, 2013).\n8 According to the Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS), “inherently safer design solutions eliminate or\nmitigate the hazard by using materials and process conditions that are less hazardous.” Center for Chemical Process\nSafety (CCPS). Inherently Safer Chemical Processes – A Life Cycle Approach. 2nd ed., Section 5.1.1, 2009.\n9 An effectiveness ranking of techniques used to control hazards and the risk they represent can be described as a\nhierarchy of controls. The further up the hierarchy, the more effective the risk reduction achieved.\n8\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\ncommitment to examine whether the implementation of the safety case regulatory regime could be a more\neffective regulatory tool to achieve major accident prevention for California petroleum refineries. The\nreader will find additional issues, arguments, and counterarguments regarding the safety case regulatory\nregime addressed in Appendix C of this report.\n1.3 Background\nAlthough both the federal and California PSM standards, respectively, were intended to be goal-setting or\nperformance-based,10,11 in practice they appear to function primarily as reactive and activity-based12\nregulatory schemes that require extensive rulemaking to modify. As a result, the federal and California\nPSM standards have become static in the face of advancing best practices and technology, with the\nemphasis placed on the completion of a task or activity rather than achievement of continuous risk\nreduction.13 Many regions around the world such as the United Kingdom (UK), Australia, and Norway\nhave acknowledged similar deficiencies and have implemented regulatory regimes consisting of both\nprescriptive14 and goal-setting elements that require duty holders15 to demonstrate to the regulator through\nrigorous reviews and audits that they have reduced risks to as low as reasonably practicable, or ALARP.\nThis is referred to as the safety case regulatory regime.16 The safety case regulatory regime is a rigorous\nprescriptive and goal-setting regulatory approach applied globally both onshore and offshore. It is\nhighlighted by its adaptability and requirements for continuous improvement in risk reduction for high\nhazard industrial facilities. A written case for safety, known as the safety case report, is generated by the\nduty holder and is generally rigorously reviewed, audited, and enforced by highly technically competent\ninspectors with skill sets familiar to those employed by the industries they oversee. Despite this global\nshift, the US has persisted in the use of a more activity-based regulatory scheme that lacks the ability to\nadapt to advancing technology and recently developed industry standards, and which has failed to\nadequately engage companies and their employees in continuous improvement and risk reduction with\nsimilarly-skilled inspectors.\n10 Also referred to as performance-based regulations, goal-setting regulatory requirements and acceptance criteria\nare specified and industry must document that their specific solutions meet such requirements, e.g. in terms of\nacceptable risk levels.\n11 See Preamble to Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals; Explosives and Blasting Agents.\nSection III. Summary and Explanation of the Final Rule (March 4, 1992).\nhttps://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=PREAMBLES&p_id=1041 (accessed August\n13, 2013).\n12 Activity-based standards and regulations require the mere completion of an activity and do not focus on the\neffectiveness of major accident prevention or risk reduction.\n13 As will be discussed below, certain sections of the PSM standard have elements of a performance-based\nregulatory approach.\n14 A prescriptive regulation or standard describes the specific means or activity-based actions to be taken for hazard\nabatement and compliance. Performance or goal-based regulations, on the other hand, state the objective to be\nobtained (such as risk reduction or hazard abatement) without describing the specific means of obtaining that\nobjective.\n15 Duty holders are considered to be “those who create and/or have the greatest control of the risks associated with a\nparticular activity. Those who create the risks at the workplace are responsible for controlling them.” HSE.\nPlanning to do business in the UK offshore oil and gas industry?

These entities may include operators, contractors, and subcontractors.\nhttp://www.hse.gov.uk/offshore/guidance/entrants.pdf (accessed June 5, 2013).\n16 Norway’s offshore regulatory regime is not referred to as the safety case regime, but it does contain many of the\nsame elements as the safety case regime, with some differences in style, substances, and implementation.\n9\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\n1.4 Key Findings\nTechnical\n1. In the ten years prior to the incident, highly knowledgeable and experienced Chevron technical staff\nrepeatedly recommended that inspectors perform 100 percent component inspections on high temperature\ncarbon steel piping susceptible to sulfidation corrosion. These recommendations were not implemented\nby Chevron management.17\n2. Chevron technical staff recommended implementing inherently safer designs through the MOC\nprocess, incident investigations, technical reports, and past recommendations from employees. However,\nChevron failed to implement proposed inherently safer recommendations prior to the incident. For\nexample, an inspection recommendation to upgrade piping to 9-Chrome was made, but the MOC to\nimplement the recommendation narrowed the scope, allowing the 52-inch component that failed to remain\nin service.\n3. In January 2007, a failure due to sulfidation corrosion caused a fire in the Chevron Richmond\nRefinery crude unit, initiating a shelter-in-place for the surrounding community. A carbon steel piping\nspool18 failed catastrophically during operation. Chevron informed Contra Costa Health Services’\nHazardous Materials Program19 in a letter that the crude unit piping metallurgy had been upgraded\nfollowing this incident as an inherently safer solution. However, this upgrade was limited to only the\nimmediate piping spool that had failed. The inherently safer, more corrosion resistant metallurgy was not\nimplemented more broadly in the crude unit as a result of this incident.\n4. Chevron and Chevron Energy Technology Company metallurgists, materials engineers, and piping\ninspectors had expertise regarding sulfidation corrosion. However, they had limited practical influence to\nimplement their recommendations. They did not participate in the most recent crude unit PHA, and they\ndid not affect decisions concerning control of sulfidation corrosion during the crude unit turnaround\nprocess.20\n5. The 2009 crude unit PHA did not identify corrosion as a potential cause of a leak or rupture in piping.\nThe PHA cited non-specific, judgment-based qualitative safeguards to reduce risk, such as: utilizing\nmetallurgy to minimize corrosion, having effective maintenance and inspection programs, and providing\npipe wall corrosion allowances.21 The effectiveness of these safeguards was neither evaluated nor\n17 These recommendations are discussed in detail in paragraphs 44 through 51 of the Chevron Interim Report.\n18 A piping spool is a small, removable section of piping. In some cases, a piping spool is installed or removed in\norder to provide a temporary connection or complete disconnection between two piping circuits.\n19 Contra Costa Health Services’ Hazardous Materials program is designed to respond to emergencies and monitor\nhazardous materials within Contra Costa County. See http://cchealth.org/hazmat/ (accessed April 17, 2013).\n20 The turnaround process includes both the planning stage prior to the shutdown and the activities staged during the\nshutdown.\n21 Corrosion allowance refers to extra wall thickness added as a safety factor to the design of a piece of equipment\nbeyond that needed solely for mechanical considerations such as design temperature and pressure. This extra\nthickness is provided to accommodate for expected loss of wall thickness due to corrosion over the life of the\nequipment.\n10\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\ndocumented; instead the safeguards were merely listed in the PHA. Had the adequacy of these safeguards\nbeen verified, improved safeguards intended to protect against sulfidation-induced failure of carbon steel\npiping could have been recommended.\nRegulatory\n6. Following the August 6th incident, California’s Division of Occupational Safety and Health\n(Cal/OSHA) inspected the Chevron facility and issued citations. Only one citation was related to PHAs;\nand it was not associated with evaluating the effectiveness of safeguards. Rather, the emphasis was that\nChevron’s PHA did not adequately account for hazards caused by other units associated with the crude\nunit. Had the California PSM standard required documentation of the effectiveness of safeguards,\nChevron would have been obligated to conduct this analysis.\n7. There is a significant discrepancy in the compensation between the California regulators and the\nChevron Richmond Refinery personnel they interact with. The California regulators also lack the\ntechnical staff with the necessary skills, knowledge, and experience to provide sufficient direct oversight\nof petroleum refineries in California.\n8. The CSB has examined records that demonstrate a considerable problem with significant and deadly\nincidents at petroleum refineries over the last decade. The EPA has noted 234 recordable accidents at\npetroleum refineries between 2000 and 2010. This is more than any other industry despite the fact that\nthe nation’s petroleum refineries make up only roughly one percent of the some 13,000 facilities covered\nby the EPA’s Risk Management Program. In 2007, OSHA stated that according to its IMIS (Integrated\nManagement Information System) database, since May 1992, 36 fatality/catastrophe (FAT/CAT)\nincidents related to HHC releases in the refining industry occurred. These incidents included 52\nemployee deaths and 250 employee injuries, 98 of these injuries required hospitalization. This number\nsurpassed the combined total of the next three highest industries over the same period. In 2010, an OSHA\nofficial testified to a Congressional Subcommittee that over 20 major incidents resulting in injuries or\nfatalities across the country occurred between 2005 and 2010, including the Tesoro Anacortes explosion\nand fire in Washington. These incidents all repeated a lesson that should have already been learned by\nthe industry. Finally, in 2012 alone, the CSB tracked 125 significant process safety incidents at US\npetroleum refineries. Seventeen of these took place in California.\n9. Under the existing regulatory regimes for onshore petroleum refineries in the US and California, such\nas the PSM and RMP programs, there is no requirement to reduce risks to ALARP. For example, under\nboth PSM and RMP an employer must “control” hazards when conducting a process hazard analysis\n(PHA) of a covered process. However, there is no requirement to address the effectiveness of the controls\nor the hierarchy of controls. Thus, a PHA that meets the regulatory requirements may inadequately\nidentify or mitigate major hazard risk. In addition, there is no requirement to submit PHAs to the\nregulator, and the regulator is not responsible for assessing the quality of the PHA or the proposed\nsafeguards.\n11\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\n10. The PSM standard does not effectively establish goals to prevent accidents or reduce risk. Only two\nof the 14 elements (PHA and mechanical integrity) of the PSM standard contain some goal-setting\ncomponent.\n11. In the last decade, the CSB has made a number of process-safety related recommendations to OSHA\nand EPA in its investigation reports and studies (e.g. Motiva, BP Texas City, and Reactive Hazards).\nHowever, none of the regulatory recommendations have been implemented, and there have been no\nsubstantive changes made to the PSM and RMP regulations to improve the prevention of major accidents.\n12. Available data from Norway and the United Kingdom (UK) shows a reduction in hydrocarbon\nreleases offshore under the safety case regulatory regime.22\n13. Regulatory approaches similar to the safety case regulatory regime, which require risk reduction to\nALARP or equivalent, have been implemented in the nuclear sector by the Nuclear Regulatory\nCommission (NRC) and the aerospace sector by NASA.\n14. Independent studies of the safety case regulatory regime in the UK have identified improvements to\nsafety performance from the safety case and a variety of stakeholders, including major oil companies,\nhave shown support of the safety case.23\n1.5 Regulatory Conclusions\nThe existing regulatory regimes for onshore petroleum refineries in the US and California:\n1. Rely on a safety and environmental management system framework that is primarily activity-based\nrather than requiring goal-based risk reduction to as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP) or\nequivalent.\n2. Are static, unable to adapt to innovation and advances in the management of major hazard risks.\n3. Do not require that companies effectively manage the risks they create; nor do they require regulator\nevaluation of the effectiveness of safeguards or regulator acceptance of companies’ plans for controlling\nthose risks.\n4. Do not ensure continuous improvement by effectively incorporating lessons learned from major\naccidents; nor do they require companies to address newly-identified safety issues as a result of such\nincidents.\n5. Do not effectively collect or promote industry use of major accident performance indicators to drive\nindustry to reduce risks to ALARP.\n22 Norway’s indicator data is discussed in Section 4.5. The UK data is discussed in Appendix C.\n23 See Sections 2.0, 3.2.1.2, and 3.2.2.3. Also see FAQ 4.\n12\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\n6. Do not require the use or implementation of inherently safer systems analysis or hierarchy of controls.\n7. Do not effectively involve the workforce in risk reduction and prevention of major accidents.\n8. Do not provide the regulator with the authority to accept or reject a company’s hazard analysis, risk\nassessment, or proposed safeguards; and\n9. Do not employ the requisite number of staff with the technical skills, knowledge, and experience to\nprovide sufficient direct safety oversight of petroleum refineries.\n1.6 Recommendations\nAs a result of the findings and conclusions of this report, the CSB makes recommendations, summarized\nbelow, to the state of California:\nCalifornia State Legislature,\nGovernor of California\nEnhance and restructure California’s process safety management (PSM) regulations for petroleum\nrefineries by including the goal-setting attributes identified in this report for petroleum refineries in the\nstate of California.\n________________________________________\nMayor and City Council,\nCity of Richmond, California\nEstablish or cause to be established a compensation system to ensure regulator capability in process safety\noversight and policy development in Richmond, California.\n________________________________________\nBoard of Supervisors\nContra Costa County, California\nEstablish a compensation system to ensure regulator capability in process safety oversight and policy\ndevelopment in Contra Costa County, California.\n________________________________________\nSection 8.0 details the recommendations.\n13\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\n2.0 Introduction\nDespite the fact that the nation’s roughly 150 petroleum refineries represent only a small fraction of the\nthousands of industrial and chemical facilities that exist in the US, the CSB has seen a great number of\nserious and deadly incidents at refineries over the last decade.\nIn March 2005, the BP Texas City Refinery suffered one of the worst industrial accidents in recent US\nhistory, when overfill of a distillation column resulted in an explosion and fire that led to 15 fatalities,\nanother 180 injuries, and the issuance of a shelter-in-place order that required 43,000 people to remain\nindoors. Houses were damaged as far as three-quarters of a mile away from the refinery. In a 2006\nstatement, former CSB Chairwoman Carolyn Merritt said that while BP did make some safety\nimprovements before the March 2005 explosion, “the focus of many of these initiatives was on improving\nprocedural compliance and reducing occupational injury rates, while catastrophic safety risks\nremained….”24\nIn November 2009, an explosion at the Silver Eagle Refinery damaged over 100 homes in a nearby\nsubdivision in Woods Cross, Utah. At a public meeting to discuss the incident, former CSB Chairman\nJohn Bresland called on refineries to improve their safety performance, stating:\nThe frequency of accidents in US refineries is very troubling. These\naccidents cost lives, inflict serious injuries and can harm communities.\nThey also earn scrutiny from government regulators; in the past few\nweeks a refinery in Texas drew the largest OSHA fine in history, more\nthan US $80 million, for alleged process safety violations. I call on all\nrefineries to redouble their commitment to safer operations and safer\ncommunities. The current rate of accidents in refineries is not\nsustainable and it is not acceptable.25\nOn the five-year anniversary of the BP Texas City explosion in March 2010, Chairman Bresland\ncontinued to relay his concern regarding refinery safety, noting that “refinery accidents…continue to\noccur with dismaying frequency…[and] will only stop when every refinery has made the financial and\nhuman commitment to sound process safety management.”26 Yet just ten days later, seven workers were\nfatally injured at the Tesoro refinery in Anacortes, Washington, following the catastrophic failure of a\nheat exchanger. Again, Chairman Bresland pointed out the alarming frequency of refinery incidents,\nstating that “if the aviation industry had the same number and types of incidents as the refining industry, I\ndon’t think people would be flying too much.”27\n24 Scrutiny Finds BP Safety Troubles. http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/industries/energy/2006-10-30-bp-\nblast-findings_x.htm (accessed September 5, 2013).\n25US Refineries Commitment to Safety Called Into Question. http://www.engineerlive.com/content/22354 (accessed\nSeptember 5, 2013).\n26 http://www.csb.gov/statement-from-csb-chairman-john-bresland-on-5th-anniversary-of-fatal-bp-texas-city-2005-\nexplosion/?pg=18 (accessed September 5, 2013).\n27Refinery Tragedies All Too Common. See\nhttp://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2011518449_safetysunday04m.html (accessed September 5, 2013)\n14\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\nOn June 10, 2010, OSHA Deputy Assistant Secretary Jordan Barab testified before the Senate Committee\non Health, Education, Labor and Pensions’ Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety\nregarding worker safety in US energy production industries. Mr. Barab noted that OSHA had counted\nover 20 major incidents resulting in injuries or fatalities across the country that had occurred within the\nlast five years, including the Tesoro Anacortes explosion and fire in Washington. These incidents all\nrepeated a lesson that should have already been learned by the industry.28 According to Mr. Barab, “[t]his\ncycle of workers being hurt or killed because their employers failed to implement well-known safety\nmeasures points out major deficiencies in chemical process safety management in the nation’s refineries\nand, quite possibly, to systemic safety and health problems in the entire petrochemical industry.”29\nAccording to OSHA’s compliance instruction document CPL-03-00-00430 on the OSHA Petroleum\nProcess Safety Management National Emphasis Program (NEP) issued in 2007,\nSince the PSM standard was promulgated by OSHA in 1992, no other\nindustry sector has had as many fatal or catastrophic incidents related to\nthe release of HHC [highly hazardous chemicals] as the petroleum\nrefining industry []. According to OSHA's IMIS [Integrated Management\nInformation System] database, since May 1992, 36 fatality/catastrophe\n(FAT/CAT) incidents related to HHC releases in the refining industry\nhave occurred. These incidents included 52 employee deaths and 250\nemployee injuries, 98 of these injuries required hospitalization. The\nnumber of refinery FAT/CAT incidents surpasses the combined total of\nthe next three highest industries over the same period (SIC 2899\nChemical Manufacturing, Not Elsewhere Classified (NEC) – 12\nFAT/CATs; SIC 2869 Industrial Organic Chemical Manufacturing, NEC\n– 12 FAT/CATs; and SIC 2892 Explosive Manufacturing – 11\nFAT/CATs).31\nIn 2012 alone, the CSB tracked 125 significant32 process safety incidents at US petroleum refineries,\nwhich are listed in Appendix A. Seventeen of these took place in California, including a major release of\n8,614 pounds of highly toxic hydrogen sulfide at the Chevron Richmond Refinery on August 2, 2012, just\nfour days prior to the incident.\nOf the 14 major accidents that the CSB is currently investigating, five occurred in petroleum refineries.\nThese include two separate explosions at the Silver Eagle refinery in Woods Cross, Utah, which resulted\nin injuries and offsite consequences, and a series of equipment failures at CITGO’s refinery in Corpus\nChristi, Texas, involving highly toxic hydrogen fluoride. In May 2014, the CSB released its final\n28 Jordan Barab’s Congressional testimony is available at\nhttp://www.dol.gov/ocia/congressionaltestimony/20100610_JBarab.htm (accessed January 7, 2014).\n29 Ibid.\n30 OSHA Instruction CPL 03-00-004.

The CSB believes that incidents that result in disruptions to the national\nenergy supply, serious injuries, or receive high media attention are all significant.\n15\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\ninvestigation report on the heat exchanger rupture at the Tesoro refinery in Anacortes, Washington, which\nresulted in seven fatalities. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has also documented 234\nrecordable accidents at petroleum refineries between 2000 and 2010. Despite the fact that the nation’s\npetroleum refineries make up only roughly one percent of the some 13,000 facilities covered by the\nEPA’s Risk Management Program, they accounted for more incidents in that time period than any other\nindustry, including the much larger sector of chemical manufacturing, which EPA documented as having\n218 recordable accidents.33\nThe CSB concludes that the continuing occurrence of refinery accidents demonstrates the pressing need to\nexamine the current regulatory structure in place in the US and, in light of the Chevron incident, in the\nstate of California for petroleum refineries. There have been a number of positive developments in the\nwake of the Chevron incident that demonstrate California’s prime opportunity to lead the nation in\nimplementing changes to improve safety and health in the refining industry. In the Fall of 2012 following\nthe Chevron incident, California Governor Jerry Brown created the California Interagency Working\nGroup on Refinery Safety (“the working group”), charged with improving cooperation among agencies,\nincluding the EPA, Cal EPA, California’s Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA), and\nContra Costa County, with the goal of improving safety at California’s petroleum refineries and\npreventing major accidents.\nThe working group began its initiative by commissioning the Labor Occupational Health Program34\n(LOHP) to conduct “listening panels” throughout California, enabling community members to meet with\nworking group members to discuss their concerns surrounding refineries. LOHP convened a series of\nmeetings and conference calls with labor unions, community-based organizations, fire agencies, and\nenvironmental health groups between November 6, 2012, and March 18, 2013. Dr. Michael P. Wilson,\nthe former Director of LOHP,35 documented his findings and recommendations regarding refinery safety\nin a summary report entitled Refinery Safety in California: Labor, Community and Fire Agency Views,\nwhich was released on June 4, 2013.36 In the report, Dr. Wilson quoted Swiss Re’s finding that the US\nhas experienced financial losses from refinery incidents that are three times that of industry counterparts\nin countries within the “EU cluster,”37 a gap which continues to grow due in part to the US refining\nindustry’s “pushing…mode of operation”, its “compliance-driven focus on safety”, and “a ‘detached’\nworkforce….”38\n33 Matthiessen, Craig.

He also stated that California’s\nrefineries are able to operate without demonstrating competence in health, safety, and environmental\nperformance to a regulatory agency or to the public, and as such recommended that California establish a\nregulatory approach similar to that of the safety case regulatory regime, a rigorous prescriptive39 and\ngoal-setting40 regulatory regime used widely by other regions throughout the world such as the United\nKingdom (UK) and Australia to regulate high hazard industrial facilities. It is highlighted by its\nadaptability and requirements for continuous improvements in risk reduction, places the duty on industry\nto demonstrate its competence in health and safety to the regulator. The regime is overseen by highly\ncompetent, well-funded regulators that rigorously audit facilities for compliance with the written safety\ncase report and good industry practice.\nOn July 11, 2013, the working group released a draft report entitled Improving Public and Worker Safety\nat Oil Refineries,41 which the CSB has recognized as an important step forward in improving petroleum\nrefinery safety and environmental performance both in California and nationally. The report outlined the\nprocess of adopting several of the CSB‘s recommendations from its Interim Report on the Chevron\nincident, including requiring refineries to implement inherently safer systems and conduct damage\nmechanism hazard reviews. Furthermore, the report announced the creation of an Interagency Refinery\nTask Force within the California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal/EPA) by September 1, 2013,\naimed at facilitating information sharing and improving coordination of oversight and enforcement\nactivities among regulatory agencies. The CSB welcomed the report’s recommendation for California to\nstudy the safety case regulatory approach.\nIn addition to the work being done by the working group, the California State Legislature approved a\n2013-2014 state budget bill (AP 110) that allows the California Department of Industrial Relations to\ncharge state petroleum refineries a “fee” by March 31, 2014, to help pay for at least 15 new positions in\nCal/OSHA’s Process Safety Unit, which enforces the California Process Safety Management (PSM)\nstandard throughout the state.42\nThe Chevron incident also spurred the formation of the City of Richmond’s Refinery Action\nCollaborative (“the collaborative”), which was launched on January 30, 2013.

The collaborative advocates for community and worker safety, better transparency, and\nenvironmental health, and has already made recommendations to the working group to improve emissions\nreporting and require more thorough assessments of pipe corrosion damage at oil refineries.46\nOn October 10, 2013, the collaborative formally responded in a memo to the July 2013 draft report issued\nby the Interagency Working Group on Refinery Safety (Improving Public and Worker Safety at Oil\nRefineries). In the memo, the collaborative stated its support for the working group’s findings and\nrecommendations. The collaborative also issued its own recommendations and highlighted 12 principles\nas being important to the development of effective regulatory policy in California. These principles\ninclude linking regulatory non-compliance to an operator’s license to operate and integrating meaningful\nparticipation in decision-making by workers and communities.47 The collaborative also noted in the\nmemo that it supported “shifting the ‘burden of proof’ of safety from public agencies to the industry, as is\nrequired in the ‘Safety Case’ approach….”48\nThe CSB noted in its Chevron Interim Report the important role of transparency between industry and the\npublic in improving health and safety for the facility and the surrounding communities. Following the\nChevron incident the collaborative, worker representatives, regulators, and governmental bodies played a\nkey role in driving transparency, accountability, and improved risk reduction during the decision-making\nprocess related to crude unit piping repairs. The CSB recommended to the California State Legislature in\nthe Interim Report to establish a multi-agency process safety regulatory program for all California\npetroleum refineries to further improve public accountability and transparency by establishing a system to\nreport to the regulator methodologies, findings, conclusions, and corrective actions related to refinery\nmechanical integrity inspection and repair work arising from California petroleum refinery PHAs,\nturnarounds, and maintenance-related shutdowns.49 This system would require reporting of information\nsuch as damage mechanism hazard reviews, establish procedures for greater workforce and public\nparticipation, and provide mechanisms for federal, state, and local agency operational coordination,\n43 The USW is the largest industrial union in North America and has approximately 1.2 million active and retired\nmembers in the US, Canada, and the Caribbean.

California is actively working to implement this\nrecommendation through the creation of the Interagency Refinery Task Force mentioned above.\nIt is also important to note that a growing dialogue has emerged throughout the US surrounding the need\nto improve the regulation of hazardous materials and processes, to which the CSB has been an important\ncontributor. The CSB first examined the safety case in its 2002 investigation report entitled Improving\nReactive Hazard Management50 as a potentially effective alternative framework for the regulation of\nreactive hazards. The CSB noted that successful implementation of this “comprehensive” regulatory\napproach required a competent and experienced regulator. In December 2010, the CSB held a public\nhearing in Washington, DC on the Regulatory Approaches to Offshore Oil and Gas Safety, where\ninternationally recognized experts in industrial safety and accident analysis provided important testimony\non managing risks offshore.51 Much of this testimony supported the implementation of the safety case as\na model for regulating major hazards, both onshore and off. For example, a Shell Oil Company\nrepresentative testified that the company had been using the safety case globally since 2002, and noted\nthat the most valuable aspect of that type of regulatory regime was the need to demonstrate that major\nhazards have been managed using effective barriers52 and controls. In July 2012, the CSB held an\nadditional public hearing on Safety Performance Indicators.53 A number of international regulators\ntestified on the regulator’s ability under the safety case to drive continuous improvement in the oil and\ngas industry. Finally, on July 25, 2013, the CSB held a public meeting to discuss the U.S. Occupational\nSafety and Health Administration’s (OSHA’s) failure to implement a number of key CSB safety\nrecommendations made to OSHA in the last decade to revise and improve its Process Safety Management\n(PSM) standard and to issue a new combustible dust standard.\nOn January 18, 2011, President Obama issued Executive Order 13563,54 which called for improvements\nin the nation’s regulatory system to promote predictability and reduce uncertainty and to use the best,\nmost innovative, and least burdensome tools for achieving regulatory ends. Specifically, it directed that\nagencies review existing and proposed standards and regulations to ensure they effectively protect “public\nhealth, welfare, safety, and our environment while promoting economic growth, innovation,\ncompetitiveness, and job creation.”55 Finally, the order emphasized that to the extent feasible, regulations\nand standards should specify performance objectives rather than the behavior or manner of compliance\nthat regulated entities must adopt, and be adopted through a process that involves public participation. As\na result of this Executive Order, OSHA, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE),\nthe EPA, the Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration\n50 A full copy of the report is available at http://www.csb.gov/improving-reactive-hazard-management/ (accessed\nJuly 10, 2013).\n51 For a copy of the transcript from the CSB Public Hearing on the Regulatory Approaches to Offshore Oil and Gas\nSafety, see http://www.csb.gov/assets/1/19/Transcript_of_Public_Meeting_12_15_2010.pdf (accessed August 14,\n2013).\n52 A barrier is a “technical, operational and/or organizational element[] which individually or collectively reduce[s]\nopportunities for specific error, hazard or accident to occur, or which limits its harm/drawbacks.” Petroleum Safety\nAuthority.

The forum included a discussion of the safety case regulatory regime as a\nperformance-based regulatory model, and industrial safety and accident analysis expert Dr. Andrew\nHopkins spoke in support of that model.\nIn the wake of the April 2013 explosion and fire that occurred at a fertilizer storage and distribution\nfacility in West, Texas, and resulted in fifteen fatalities and hundreds of injuries, President Obama issued\nExecutive Order 1365058 on August 1, 2013. The Executive Order established the Chemical Facility\nSafety and Security Working Group, a working group of federal agencies59 tasked with, among other\nthings, developing options for enhancing and modernizing policies, regulations, and standards to improve\nthe safety and security of chemical facilities.60 As will be discussed in Section 4.3, the group has\nincluded the safety case regulatory model in a list of potential actions it may consider taking to improve\nchemical safety regulation.61\nThe CSB has utilized a broad range of expert testimony and research to gain a comprehensive\nunderstanding of regulatory models for onshore and offshore oil and gas facilities in countries around the\nworld, and, in light of this investigation, the state of California. This report highlights the significant\nattributes of the safety case regime that together result in a more effective regulatory approach to process\nsafety and risk reduction. It also provides a detailed contrast of the safety case regulatory model to the\nexisting regulatory structures in the US and California, and makes recommendations to improve\nCalifornia’s regulatory oversight of its petroleum refineries and to promote a broader national dialogue on\nthe safety case regulatory approach.\n56 For more information see\nhttps://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=FEDERAL_REGISTER&p_id=23267\n(accessed July 10, 2013).\n57 See https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=FEDERAL_REGISTER&p_id=23267\n(accessed August 13, 2013).\n58 Improving Chemical Facility Safety and Security.

According to industrial safety and\naccident analysis expert Dr. Andrew Hopkins, “[d]isasters…offer an unparalleled opportunity to study the\nworkings of an organisation and to identify where things are going wrong.”62 Around the world, many of\nthese large-scale incidents have resulted in sweeping changes to legislation surrounding industrial safety\nand health. These changes replace prescriptive, compliance-based regulations with goal-setting\nregulations supplemented by prescriptive requirements that support adaptability, require duty holders63 to\ndemonstrate to the regulator that they have driven risks to as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP) or\nequivalent, and provide the regulator with the tools to drive continuous improvement among major hazard\nfacilities.64 A majority of these regulatory regimes are referred to as the safety case, which Dr. Hopkins\ndefines as:\na case which the operator of a hazardous facility makes to the regulator,\nsetting out how safety is to be managed. It must include details of the\nhazard identification process, the hazards which have been identified and\nthe procedures which have been set in place to control them. The system\nremains self-regulatory in principle but rather than the facility being left\nto its own devices by the regulator it must convince the regulator that its\nstrategy for managing safety is satisfactory [emphasis added]. Under\nany safety case regime, facility operators are expected to adopt best\npractice risk management.65\nThe safety case regulatory regime is much more than a written report; it shifts risk management\nresponsibility to the company and its employees and provides for rigorous review and oversight by a\ntechnically competent regulator to ensure effective implementation.66\n62 Hopkins, Andrew. Managing Major Hazards: The Lessons of the Moura Mine Disaster; National Library of\nAustralia, 1999; p 1.\n63 Duty holders are considered to be “those who create and/or have the greatest control of the risks associated with a\nparticular activity.

Rarely is this done proactively under the\n21\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\nThe remaining portions of Section 3 will introduce major accidents that have occurred around the world\nand discuss the history behind the global development and implementation of the safety case regulatory\napproach on and offshore. Section 4.0 will then highlight major attributes of the safety case regulatory\napproach. The US regulatory model will also be introduced and discussed throughout these sections to\nallow for comparisons between the different approaches. Finally, Section 5.0 will discuss the regulation\nof petroleum refineries in California specifically, including Chevron. The report concludes with\nimportant recommendations focused on improving the regulatory oversight of California’s 14 refineries,\nand encouraging OSHA, industry, labor, and others to work together to improve the regulation of\npetroleum refineries throughout the US.\n3.2 Initial Safety Case Implementation\n3.2.1 United Kingdom\n3.2.1.1 Onshore\nTwo major onshore incidents in the 1970s helped spark legislative reform focused on major accident\nprevention and risk reduction for onshore major hazard facilities. A large dioxin67 release in Seveso,\nItaly, in 1976, which injured hundreds of individuals, led the European Commission68 to adopt legislation\nin 1982 known as the Seveso Directive, aimed at the prevention and control of major industrial\naccidents.69 Following the 1984 toxic release in Bhopal, India, which resulted in several thousand known\nfatalities, and the Sandoz chemical plant fire near Basel, Switzerland, which injured 14 individuals and\nreleased nearly 30 tons of pesticides into the Rhine River, turning it red, the Seveso Directive was\namended and replaced in 1996 with the Seveso II Directive.70 The regulation requires owners or\noperators of facilities that contain threshold quantities of listed substances to submit safety reports to a\ncompetent authority (CA) within a Member State of the European Commission for its review and\nacceptance.71 These reports must demonstrate to the CA that major-accident prevention policies, safety\nmanagement systems, and internal emergency plans have been created and implemented.72 The\ncurrent system. The Refinery NEP is a primary example of proactive inspections to verify compliance. It was\ndiscontinued in 2011.\n67 The term Dioxin refers to a family of toxic chemicals. They have been characterized by EPA as likely to be\nhuman carcinogens and are anticipated to increase the risk of cancer at background levels of exposure. See\nhttp://www.epa.gov/pbt/pubs/dioxins.htm (accessed June 17, 2013).\n68 The European Commission consists of 27 Commissioners and “represents the interests of the EU [European\nUnion] as a whole.

On December 9, 1996, the\nSeveso II Directive was adopted and replaced the original Seveso Directive. The Seveso III Directive was then\nadopted on July 4, 2012, and became effective on August 13, 2012. Member States must implement Seveso III by\nJune 1, 2015. http://ec.europa.eu/environment/seveso/ (accessed May 6, 2013).\n71See http://ec.europa.eu/environment/seveso/legislation.htm (accessed May 6, 2013).\n72 Seveso II Directive, Article 9 (1996).

This\nincident along with the Seveso incident led to the\nSeveso Directive in 1982, and this was converted into\nlegislation in the United Kingdom (UK) via the Control\nof Industrial Major Accident Hazards (CIMAH) 1984\nRegulations. The Control of Major Accidents74 Hazards\nRegulations (COMAH) replaced CIMAH in April 1999\nto conform to the updated Seveso II Directive. The\nHealth and Safety Executive75 (HSE), the Environment\nAgency76 (EA), and the Scottish Environmental\nProtection Agency77 (SEPA) are considered to be the\nUK’s CA responsible for the enforcement of these\nregulations. A key feature differentiating these two\nregulations is the increasing emphasis from the operator\nhaving to “describe” the safety systems in CIMAH to\nbeing required to “demonstrate” their adequacy in\nCOMAH.78\n73 Seveso II Directive, Article 5, Paragraph 2 (1996).

It requires\nemployers to ensure that risks to employees and others are reduced “so far as is reasonably practicable,” or SFAIRP.\nHealth and Safety at Work etc. Act, Part I, Section 2 (1) and (2) (1974). HSE has interpreted that SFAIRP duties\ncall for the same set of tests to be applied as duties to reduce risks “as low as reasonably practicable,” or ALARP.\nAccording to HSE, “”the two terms mean essentially the same thing and at their core is the concept of ‘reasonably\npracticable’;…” See http://www.hse.gov.uk/risk/theory/alarpglance.htm (accessed May 7, 2013).\n85 According to HSE, the concept of “reasonably practicable” “involves weighing a risk against the trouble, time and\nmoney needed to control it. Thus, ALARP describes the level to which [they] expect to see workplace risks\ncontrolled.” This allows HSE to “set goals for duty-holders, rather than being prescriptive; HSE’s policy is that any\nproposed regulatory action should be based on what is reasonably practicable.” According to HSE, in most\nsituations, deciding whether the risks are ALARP involves a “comparison between the control measures a duty-\nholder has in place or is proposing and the measures [they] would normally expect to see in such circumstances i.e.\nrelevant good practice. ‘Good practice’ is defined as ‘those standards for controlling risk that HSE has judged and\nrecognized as satisfying the law, when applied to a particular relevant case, in an appropriate manner.’… Once what\nis good practice has been determined, much of the discussion with duty-holders about whether a risk is or will be\nALARP is likely to be concerned with the relevance of the good practice, and how appropriately it has been (or will\nbe) implemented.” See http://www.hse.gov.uk/risk/theory/alarpglance.htm (accessed May 7, 2013).\n86COMAH Regulations, Schedule 4, Part 1 (2005).

These incidents initiated\noffshore regulatory changes focused on risk reduction and control that were modeled after the CIMAH\nregulations.\nFollowing the Piper Alpha incident, the UK Secretary of State for the Department of Energy ordered that\na public inquiry be held to determine the circumstances surrounding the incident.92 The Secretary\ndirected Lord Cullen, a Senator of the College of Justice in Scotland, to hold the inquiry and report to the\nSecretary “the circumstances of the accident and its cause together with any observations and\nrecommendations which he thinks fit to make with a view to the preservation of life and the avoidance of\nsimilar accidents in the future.”93\nThe result was The Public Inquiry into the Piper Alpha Disaster (“the Cullen Report”), an extensive\nreport released in October 1990. The report called into question the adequacy of the detailed prescriptive\nregulatory regime that existed at the time of the incident94 for offshore oil and gas operations, and listed\n106 recommendations to revamp offshore safety regulation in the UK, 57 of which the HSE was\nresponsible for overseeing.95\nThe Cullen Report found that the operating company (Occidental Petroleum, a US company), “did not\npossess any system which ensured that such remote, but potentially disastrous, events were subjected to\nsystematic scrutiny…[and] there was for major projects no comprehensive system of safety assessment\nand management did not appear to appreciate fully the contribution which it could make.”96 The report\nnoted that there was a need for a formal safety assessment (FSA), “an assessment essentially equivalent to\nthe Safety Case,”97 which “involves the identification and assessment of hazards over the whole life cycle\nof a project…[because]…the combinations of potential hardware and human failures are so numerous that\na major accident hardly ever repeats itself…[and] [a] strategy for risk management must [] address the\nentire spectrum of possibilities.”98\n90 The Alexander Kielland was a flotel for housing workers. A total of 212 people were on board when it capsized\nnear the Edda platform in the Ekofisk area of the North Sea on March 27, 1980. As a result of this incident, 123\nindividuals lost their lives and only 89 survived.\n91 On July 6, 1988, an explosion occurred aboard the Piper Alpha oil production platform 120 miles off the coast of\nScotland in the North Sea. A series of explosions and fire killed 167 workers and almost completed destroyed the\nplatform. This incident became the deadliest accident in the history of the offshore industry.\n92 Department of Energy.

In response,\nthe UK established the Offshore Installations (Safety Case) Regulations in 1992.105 The primary goal of\nthese Regulations was “to reduce the risks from major accident hazards to the health and safety of the\nworkforce employed on offshore installations or in connected activities.”106\nOil & Gas UK, 107 the main UK offshore oil industry trade association whose members include the major\noil companies that operate in the Gulf of Mexico (such Shell and Exxon), has expressed strong support for\nthe safety case regime. In its response to the European Commission’s published draft legislative\nproposals to modify offshore safety case regulations, Oil & Gas UK noted that those proposals would\nundermine the “proactive, flexible and responsive approach to managing risks, borne out of the lessons\nlearnt from Piper Alpha as well as the evolving nature of the offshore oil and gas business itself.”108 In\nthe wake of the Macondo incident in the Gulf of Mexico, the UK government directed Professor Geoffrey\n99 Department of Energy.

In 1991, the\nCommittee released its Report of the Consultative Committee on Safety in the Offshore Petroleum\nIndustry.112 In the report, the Committee examined the circumstances, causes, and recommendations\ndescribed in both the Cullen Report and Esso Australia’s113 investigation report on a fire that occurred on\nthe Tuna platform in April 1989 in Bass Strait that injured four individuals. The Committee noted that\nwhile there were many differences between the two incidents, they “both demonstrated the need for\ngreater attention to the management of safety in a number of areas of offshore operations.”114 They\npointed to the safety case as an important regulatory concept that should be applied to oil and gas\noperations in Australian waters, and concluded by recommending that the safety case concept described\nby Lord Cullen and carried out onshore by the Seveso Directive and CIMAH regulations be adopted for\nAustralian offshore petroleum operations.115 It would “require the operator of a facility to formally\ndocument how safety is to be managed within the facility, [and] [] demonstrate that the major hazards of\nthe installation have been identified and appropriate controls provided…”116 The Committee also\nrecommended the implementation of both prescriptive and “objective” regulations.117 At that time,\noffshore petroleum safety was the joint responsibility of the Commonwealth and the States/Northern\nTerritory. Following this inquiry, new Commonwealth regulations were created: for example, Schedule\n109 Maitland, Geoffrey.

The operator of an offshore petroleum facility must submit a\nsafety case for review and acceptance to the Australian National Offshore Petroleum Safety and\nEnvironmental Management Authority (NOPSEMA), the Australian Commonwealth Statutory Agency\ncharged with regulating the health and safety, structural integrity, and environmental management of all\noffshore petroleum facilities in Australian Commonwealth waters, and in coastal waters where State\npowers have been reduced. NOPSEMA accepts a safety case “if it is satisfied that the arrangements set\nout in the document demonstrate that the risks will be reduced to…ALARP.”118\n3.2.2.1.2 Onshore\nIn 1998, Esso Australia’s gas plant at Longford in Victoria suffered a major release and fire caused by\ncold temperature embrittlement due to a process upset and lack of engineering support for diagnosis,\nwhich resulted in two fatalities, eight additional injuries, and cut the State of Victoria’s gas supply for two\nweeks causing major industrial disruption and workforce stand downs. While the safety case at this time\nwas required for offshore operations in Australia, onshore facilities like the Longford plant were subject\nonly to prescriptive provisions contained within the Victoria Occupational Health and Safety Act 1985.\nIn its report on the incident, the Royal Commission concluded that all major hazard facilities in Victoria\nshould be required to develop and submit a safety case to the appropriate regulatory authority. In 1996,\nAustralia’s National Occupational Health and Safety Commission119 (NOHSC) recommended the safety\ncase be adopted for all major onshore hazard facilities in Australia, and in 2002 NOHSC established a\nNational Standard for the Control of Major Hazard Facilities and a National Code of Practice for the\nControl of Major Hazard Facilities.120 The Standard states that operators of major hazard facilities “shall\nprovide the relevant public authority with a safety report…” that, among other things, identifies the type,\nrelative likelihood and consequences of major accidents that might occur, and provides details of the\nsafety management system (SMS) for that facility.121 In addition, operators of major hazard facilities\nmust identify all major hazards and the risks associated with those hazards, and minimize each risk “so far\nas practicable.”122\n118 See http://www.nopsema.gov.au/safety/safety-case/what-is-a-safety-case/ (accessed July 15, 2013).\n119 In 1985 The National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (NOHSC) was established as a tripartite body\nto develop, facilitate and implement a unified national approach to occupational health and safety in Australia. On\nJanuary 1, 2006, NOHSC was replaced by the Australian Safety and Compensation Council (ASCC). On March 31,\n2009, the ASCC was abolished and replaced with Safe Work Australia. Safe Work Australia was established by the\nSafe Work Australia Act 2008 with the authority to help develop policy to improve worker health, safety, and\ncompensation across Australia. It does not regulate work health and safety laws; rather it develops national policy.\nSee http://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/sites/swa/about/pages/about (accessed May 8, 2013).\n120 National standards are documents which prescribe preventative action to avert occupational deaths, injuries and\ndiseases; national codes of practice are documents prepared for the purpose of advising employers and workers of\nacceptable ways of achieving national standards.

Although the country did not adopt the safety case regulatory regime per se, the current\nregulatory approach implements many similar elements.\nCurrently in Norway, the Petroleum Safety Authority124 (PSA) regulates safety for activities at onshore\nand offshore major hazard facilities, and requires the responsible party125 to reduce risk “to the extent\npossible,” and “select technical, operational and organisational solutions that reduce the probability that\nharm, errors and hazard and accident situations occur.”126 This concept is akin to ALARP whereby\ncompanies choose the solutions and barriers that have the greatest risk-reducing effect, provided the costs\nare not significantly disproportionate to the risk reduction achieved.127 However, unlike the UK and\nAustralia, PSA regulations do not require the submission of a safety case report by the operator of a\nfacility, although facilities are still expected to develop them and make them available to the regulator\nupon request for auditing purposes. Rather, PSA “supervises” industry, as explained in the following:\nSupervision involves much more than audits offshore or on land. It\nembraces the total contact between the regulator and the regulated. It\ncovers everything which gives the PSA the necessary basis to determine\nwhether the companies are accepting their responsibility to operate\nacceptably in all phases. Supervisory activities include investigations,\nconsidering consent applications and meetings with the industry.128\nAs will be discussed below, because the safety case regulatory approach requires the regulator to conduct\ndetailed assessments of safety case reports and auditing of facilities against the safety case, its\nimplementation requires substantial funding to support and maintain a sufficient number of highly\nexperienced and competent staff.\n123Australian Safety and Compensation Council. Major Hazard Facilities Annual Situation Report; 2004; p1.\nhttp://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/sites/SWA/about/Publications/Documents/475/MHFAnSituationReport_2004.\npdf (accessed May 8, 2013).\n124 The Petroleum Safety Authority (PSA) is “the regulatory authority for technical and operational safety and for\nthe working environment.” PSA was created in 2004 as a result of a government decision to split the Norwegian\nPetroleum Directorate (NPD) into two parts. See http://www.ptil.no/main-page/category9.html (accessed May 8,\n2013).\n125 PSA defines a “responsible party” as “[t]he operator and others participating in activities covered by these\nregulations, without being a licensee or owner of an onshore facility.” Regulations Relating to Health, Safety and\nthe Environment in the Petroleum Activities and at Certain Onshore Facilities (The Framework Regulations);\nSection 6(a).

Due to the major potential hazards present in\nonshore and offshore oil and gas operations, these sectors should have in place adaptable safety regimes\nthat adequately engage companies and their employees in continuous improvement and risk reduction.\nAs the CSB has devoted extensive time and resources to studying and analyzing the regulation of offshore\noil and gas facilities in the US as a result of its Macondo incident investigation, this report will focus on\nthe regulation of onshore oil and gas operations in the US and California.\nOn October 23, 1989, a massive explosion and fire occurred at the Phillips 66 Company’s Houston\nChemical Complex in Pasadena, Texas, resulting in 23 fatalities and injuring more than 130. In response,\nthe U.S. Department of Labor issued a report to the President and declared, among other things, that the\nU.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) would “expedite completion of its\nrulemaking requiring employers to implement comprehensive chemical process safety management plans\nfor hazardous chemical processes.”130 Sparked by a number of serious accidents, including the Phillips\n66 incident and the 1984 toxic release in Bhopal, India, which resulted in several thousand known\nfatalities, OSHA published in the Federal Register (55 FR 29150) on July 17, 1990, a proposed standard\ncontaining requirements for the management of hazards associated with processes using highly hazardous\nchemicals.131 Soon after, Congress adopted the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments (CAAA) of 1990,\n129A Shell Oil Company representative testified at the CSB December 2010 public meeting on the safety case that\nthe company had been using the safety case globally since 2002, and noted that the most valuable aspect of that type\nof regulatory regime was the need to demonstrate that major hazards have been managed using effective barriers and\ncontrols. Shell Geelong Refinery Plant Manager Huck Poh has stated, “As a Major Hazard Facility, Shell Geelong\nRefinery and Lara Terminal is required to submit a Safety Case for assessment by Safe Work Victoria. This\ndocument is a summary of that Safety Case and explains the potential impact of the facility on our neighbours and\nthe community. We take a systematic approach to managing safety and preventing incidents that place our people,\nour neighbours, the Geelong community, the environment and our facilities at risk. This is reflected in our Safety\nManagement System and the approach that has been undertaken for the development and review of the Safety Case.\nShell is committed to achieving continuous Health, Safety, Security and Environment (HSSE) performance\nimprovement. There are ongoing review and revision activities to ensure our analyses remain relevant and reflect\nthe current status of operations and our risk reduction measures are consistent with latest industry practice.

See\nhttp://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=PREAMBLES&p_id=1039 (accessed May 10,\n2013).\n30\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\nwhich resulted in the creation of the CSB and authorized the first federal regulations specifically designed\nto prevent major chemical accidents that threaten workers, the public, and the environment: OSHA’s\nProcess Safety Management (PSM) standard and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s)\nRisk Management Program.\n3.2.2.3.1 OSHA PSM Standard\nSection 304 of the CAAA mandated that OSHA develop “a chemical process safety standard designed to\nprotect employees from hazards associated with accidental release of highly hazardous chemicals in the\nworkplace.”132 OSHA responded by adopting 29 CFR §1910.119 Process Safety Management of Highly\nHazardous Chemicals (“the PSM standard”) in 1992. The PSM standard applies to a process133 involving\na chemical at or above the listed threshold quantity (also known as a highly hazardous chemical), or\nflammables in a quantity of 10,000 pounds or more.134 It contains 14 elements with broad requirements\nto implement management systems, identify and control hazards, and prevent “catastrophic releases of\nhighly hazardous chemicals.” While the PSM standard was intended to be performance-based and does\ncontain some goal-setting elements, a majority of the standard is activity-based, and there is no general\nduty requirement under the PSM standard to reduce risks to a certain extent or prevent catastrophic\naccidents. As will be discussed at length in Section 4.3, the PSM standard has essentially remained\nstagnant since its inception in 1992. According to the Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS), the\nPSM standard has resulted “in a minimum cost, compliance-based approach to managing process safety…\n‘If [it] isn’t a regulatory requirement, I’m not going to do it!’”135\nA key provision of the PSM standard is the process hazard analysis (PHA) of covered processes. 136\nPHA requirements include a review of the process to identify, evaluate, and control the hazards, and an\nevaluation of the consequences of failure of those controls.137,138 The PHA required by the OSHA PSM\nstandard is an example of a goal-setting requirement in that it allows for a variety of hazard analysis\nmethodologies to be performed to satisfy the requirement. However, the element is activity-based in that\ncompleting a PHA for each covered process and updating it at least every five years is satisfactory. The\nregulator is not responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of controls or safeguards, and there is no\nrequirement to reduce risks to a certain extent such as ALARP. Thus, the resulting PHA that meets the\n132 Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Section 304(a). November 5, 1990. See\nhttp://www.epa.gov/air/caa/caaa.txt (accessed May 10, 2013).\n133 The PSM standard defines “process” as “any activity involving a highly hazardous chemical including any use,\nstorage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.”\n29 CFR §1910.119(b) (1992).\n134 29 CFR §1910.119(a)(1) (1992). This standard also applies to the manufacture of explosives and pyrotechnics in\nany quantity [29 CFR §1910.109(k)(2) & (3)].\n135 CCPS. Guidelines for Risk Based Process Safety. 2007; p 2.\n136 A Process hazard analysis is a thorough, orderly, systematic approach for identifying, evaluating, and controlling\nhazards of processes involving highly hazardous chemicals. The employer must perform an initial process hazard\nanalysis on all processes covered by the PSM standard and all process hazard analyses must be updated and\nrevalidated, based on their completion date, every five years. See\nhttp://www.osha.gov/doc/outreachtraining/htmlfiles/psm.html (accessed May 10, 2013).\n137 29 CFR §1910.119(e) (1992).\n138 The other elements of the PSM standard are process safety information, operating procedures, employee\nparticipation, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, hot work permits,\nmanagement of change, incident investigation, emergency planning and response, and compliance audits. The 14th\n“element” is mainly a requirement that maintaining trade secrecy not interfere with an employer’s compliance with\nthe other 13 elements.\n31\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\nregulatory requirements of “controlling” hazards may actually inadequately identify or mitigate the\nhazards. In addition, there is no requirement for employers to submit their PHAs to the regulator for\nreview. In most cases, this means the regulator will not review these PHAs until there is a significant\nprocess accident, a complaint, or a (rare) planned inspection.\nAnother key element of the PSM standard, the Management of Change (MOC) provision, requires the\ndevelopment of written procedures “to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, and\nprocedures…”139 The procedures must consider, among other things, the technical basis for a proposed\nchange and its potential impact on safety and health.140 Historically, the MOC requirement has been\ntreated and enforced as an activity-based requirement as well. For example, when the BP Texas City\nrefinery explosion and fire occurred on March 23, 2005, all 15 fatalities and many of the 180 injuries\noccurred in or around nine contractor trailers that were sited near process areas and as close as 121 feet to\nthe isomerization (ISOM) unit where the incident occurred. The refinery had been using trailers as\ntemporary office spaces for several years. The refinery addressed facility siting for trailers during its\n2004 MOC for an upcoming 2005 turnaround. The MOC form indicated that a double-wide mobile office\ntrailer would be temporarily sited in the open area between the ISOM and naphtha desulfurization units\n(NDU) for use during the upcoming turnaround, to be removed at the end of April 2005. However, the\nMOC did not analyze siting hazards; rather the MOC team attached a drawing showing the proposed\ninterior configuration of the trailer and measured its location from the catalyst warehouse.141 In early\n2005, eight other trailers were sited between the ISOM and NDU without even conducting an MOC. The\nCSB pointed out in its Urgent Recommendations stemming from the Texas City incident that these\ntrailers could have been easily relocated to less hazardous sites, and BP did so following the incident.142\nDespite this fact, BP’s siting policy considered that utilizing trailers in this way posed little or no danger\nto occupants, which conformed with the American Petroleum Institute’s (API) Recommended Practice\n(RP) 752, Management of Hazards Associated with Location of Process Plant Buildings.\nAlthough the MOC failed to identify or analyze hazards stemming from siting trailers so close to process\nareas, OSHA did not cite BP for conducting a poor MOC following the incident, as merely completing\nthe MOC satisfied the requirements of the PSM standard. As it would have been very practical to move\nthe trailers to a safer location, a regulator under the safety case regulatory regime would have the ability\nto require BP to do just that to reduce risks to ALARP.\nThe OSHA PSM standard includes requirements for two of its 14 elements – mechanical integrity and\nprocess safety information (PSI) – to comply with recognized and generally accepted good engineering\npractices, or RAGAGEP.143 RAGAGEPs are technologically focused, with no emphasis on\n139 29 CFR §1910.119(l)(1) (1992).\n140 Id at (l)(2)(i) and (ii) (1992).\n141 To learn more about the PHA and MOC processes relating to the BP Texas City Refinery, see the CSB BP Texas\nCity Final Investigation Report at http://www.csb.gov/assets/1/19/CSBFinalReportBP.pdf (accessed October 24.\n2013).\n142 See CSB Urgent Trailer Siting Recommendations at http://www.csb.gov/assets/1/19/BP_Recs_2.pdf (accessed\nOctober 24. 2013).\n143 RAGAGEPs “are engineering, operation, or maintenance activities based on established codes, standards,\npublished technical reports or recommended practices (RP) or a similar document. RAGAGEPs detail generally\napproved ways to perform specific engineering, inspection or mechanical integrity activities, such as fabricating a\n32\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\norganizational, human factors, or culture-based measures. OSHA developed the mechanical integrity\nRAGAGEP requirement to “make sure that process equipment is inspected and tested properly, and that\nthe inspections and tests are performed in accordance with appropriate codes and standards.”144 OSHA\nhas recognized a number of practices, guidelines, and standards as RAGAGEPs, including the American\nSociety of Civil Engineers, Design of Blast Resistant Buildings in Petrochemical Facilities, the\nDepartment of Defense, TMS-1300 Structures to Resist the Effects of Accidental Explosions, and the\nAmerican Petroleum Institute (API) Recommended Practice (RP) 520: Sizing, Selection, and Installation\nof Pressure-Relieving Devices in Refineries.145 Unlike other regulators such as the HSE, OSHA has not\ncompiled a comprehensive list of good practices, or RAGAGEPs, for companies to utilize during\noperations, and the CSB has only identified two OSHA Letters of Interpretation regarding\nimplementation of RAGAGEP in PSM. According to CCPS, “[o]rganizations lack a thorough\nunderstanding of recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices and are inconsistent in\ninterpreting and applying them.”146 In addition, key PSM elements such as PHA, incident investigation,\nand MOC do not reference RAGAGEP, and have not kept up to date with good practice guidelines,\nincluding CCPS’ Guidelines for Risk Based Process Safety, which addresses 20 PSM elements for\nprocess safety, including human factors, workforce involvement, and safety culture.\nHistorically, OSHA has primarily enforced147 RAGAGEP reactively, and may cite companies for\nviolations of RAGAGEPs following an incident. For example, following the BP Texas City Refinery\nincident, OSHA issued BP hundreds of citations, some of which covered BP’s willful violations of API\n520 and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, both\nconsidered by OSHA to be RAGAGEPs. Following the Chevron incident, California’s Division of\nOccupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) issued Chevron two willful citations for allegedly not\ncomplying with API RP 939-C, Guidelines for Avoiding Sulfidation (Sulfidic) Corrosion Failures in Oil\nRefineries and Chevron’s own internal corrosion mitigation plan as RAGAGEPs (this will be discussed in\ngreater detail in Section 5.1.2.2).\n3.2.2.3.2 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Program\nSection 301(r) of the CAAA called for EPA to develop regulations related to the prevention and detection\nof accidental releases for regulated substances, including requiring owners or operators of stationary\nsources that have regulated substances present to prepare and implement a “risk management plan to\nvessel, inspecting a storage tank, or servicing a relief valve.” OSHA Instruction CPL 03-00-004.

Program 3 facilities must\nimplement elements of a prevention program, including: process safety information (PSI), PHA, standard\noperating procedures (SOPs), training, mechanical integrity, compliance audits, incident investigations,\nMOC, pre-startup reviews, employee participation, and hot work permits. These prevention program\nelements are based primarily on the OSHA PSM standard, and much of the language contained in each\nelement is identical to the PSM standard. As such, the Risk Management Program regulations contain the\nsame RAGAGEP requirements for mechanical integrity and PSI as the OSHA PSM standard for covered\nfacilities. For example, 40 CFR §68.48 requires an owner or operator to “ensure that the process is\ndesigned in compliance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices\n[RAGAGEP].”153 Like OSHA, the EPA is able to cite facilities for failure to comply with RAGAGEP\nfollowing an incident, but does not maintain a list of RAGAGEPs for reference.\nFinally, each covered facility must submit a risk management plan (RMP) to EPA for all covered\nprocesses154 and update and resubmit these plans at least once every five years, or whenever a major\naccident occurs or the emergency contact information changes. Completing and submitting the RMP\nsatisfies the regulatory requirement; again, the effectiveness of the RMP in risk reduction is not assessed\nby the EPA, rendering this another activity-based requirement for a covered facility. There is no approval\nof the RMP by the EPA, and there is no additional duty on the facility to implement what it says it is\ndoing in the RMP, unlike the safety case regulatory regime.\nAny facility with one or more covered processes must include in its RMP an executive summary; the\nregistration for the facility; the certification statement; a worst-case scenario for each process involving\nflammables or toxics; the five-year accident history for each process; information concerning emergency\n148 Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.

The EPA\nOffice of Inspector General (OIG) concluded in 2009 that over half of the RMP-covered facilities\nidentified in the US as high-risk156 had never received an on-site inspection or audit, and over 65 percent\nof all active RMP facilities had not received an on-site inspection or audit since inception of the RMP\nprogram in 1999.157 The EPA OIG also noted that of the 296 uninspected high-risk facilities regulated by\nthe EPA, 151 of these could each impact 100,000 people or more in a worst-case accident scenario.158\n3.2.2.3.3 Safety Case in the United States\nIn contrast to its mainly activity-based regulation of hazardous\nchemicals, including oil and gas operations, the US has adopted a\nmore goal-based regulatory approach for its nuclear and\naeronautics and space science sectors. The U.S. Nuclear\nRegulatory Commission (NRC) was an early adopter of goal or\nperformance-based regulation, which it defines as “[a] regulatory\napproach that focuses on desired, measureable outcomes, rather\nthan prescriptive processes, techniques, or procedures…[and] leads\nto defined results without specific direction regarding how those\nresults are to be obtained.”159 According to the NRC,\nperformance-based regulations permit licensees to “have flexibility\nto determine how to meet the established performance criteria in ways that encourage and reward\nimproved outcomes.”160 The NRC’s Reactor Oversight Process, the means by which it achieves its\nmission of public health and safety in commercial nuclear power plant operations, is its primary\n155 EPA Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response.

NASA relies on a risk-informed safety case, or RISC,168 to ensure that the system’s safety\nobjectives, goals, and thresholds have been achieved, and that safety risk is as low as possible within\nreasonable impacts on cost, schedule, and performance.169\n161 http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/risk-informed/concept/performance.html#example (accessed June 13,\n2013).\n162 NRC Reactor Oversight Process publication (2006), available at\nhttp://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML0708/ML070890365.pdf (accessed June 13, 2013).\n163 NRC Reactor Oversight Process publication (2006), available at\nhttp://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML0708/ML070890365.pdf (accessed June 13, 2013).\n164 US NRC NUREG/BR-0303, Guidance for Performance-Based Regulation (2002). http://www.nrc.gov/reading-\nrm/doc-collections/nuregs/brochures/br0303/br0303.pdf (accessed June 13, 2013).\n165 ALARA “means making every reasonable effort to maintain exposures to radiation as far below the dose limits\nin this part as is practical consistent with the purpose for which the licensed activity is undertaken, taking into\naccount the state of technology, the economics of improvements in relation to state of technology, the economics of\nimprovements in relation to benefits to the public health and safety, and other societal and socioeconomic\nconsiderations, and in relation to utilization of nuclear energy and licensed materials in the public interest.” 10 CFR\n§20.1003 (2007).\n166 US NRC NUREG/BR-0303, Guidance for Performance-Based Regulation (2002). http://www.nrc.gov/reading-\nrm/doc-collections/nuregs/brochures/br0303/br0303.pdf\n167 NASA defines ASARP as “a fundamental principle of adequate safety. A determination that a system is ASARP\nentails weighing its safety performance against the sacrifice needed to further improve it. The system is ASARP if\nan incremental improvement in safety would require a disproportionate deterioration of system performance in other\nareas.” NASA/SP-2010-580, NASA System Safety Handbook, Volume 1, System Safety Framework and Concepts\nfor Implementation; November 2011; p 5.\nhttp://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20120003291_2012003429.pdf (accessed June 10, 2013).\n168 NASA defines RISC as “a structured argument, supported by a body of evidence that provides a compelling,\ncomprehensive and valid case that a system is or will be adequately safe for a given application in a given\nenvironment. This is accomplished by addressing each of the operational safety objectives that have been negotiated\nfor the system, including articulation of a roadmap for the achievement of safety objectives that are applicable to\nlater phases of the system life cycle. The term ‘risk-informed’ is used to emphasize that a determination of adequate\nsafety is the result of a deliberative decision making process that necessarily entails an assessment of risks and tries\nto achieve a balance between the system’s safety performance and its performance in other areas.” Ibid at 13.\n169 Ibid at xiii.\n36\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\n4.0 Key Features of an Effective Safety Case Regulatory Regime\nFollowing the Macondo disaster, the National Commission on the Macondo Oil Spill and Offshore\nDrilling170 made a recommendation in its Report to the President171 for the US to “develop a proactive,\nrisk-based performance approach specific to individual facilities, operations and environments, similar to\nthe ‘safety case’ approach in North Sea.”172 Despite the major potential hazards that are present in both\nonshore and offshore oil and gas operations, the safety case regime has not been implemented in the US\nfor either sector. The US has instead implemented for major hazards at onshore facilities a more activity-\nbased approach, resulting in static regulations such as the PSM and RMP regulations that have not seen\nsignificant improvements173 since their inception, despite advances in technology and good industry\npractice.\nAccording to Dr. Hopkins and other renowned experts in the field, it is essential for an effective major\naccident prevention safety regime to take the form of a safety case, with adaptable goal-setting regulations\nthat facilitate innovation and sustainability, and that drive industry to continuously improve and reduce\nrisks to ALARP. To accomplish this, the regime must utilize sufficient numbers of highly competent\npersonnel to effectively collect or promote industry use of process safety indicators174 and to provide\nknowledgeable oversight of industry operations.\nThe CSB has determined that there are several key features of an effective major accident prevention\nregulatory approach such as the safety case regime:\n• Duty Holder Safety Responsibility, including a Written Case for Safety\n• Continuous Risk Reduction to ALARP\n• Adaptability and Continuous Improvement\n• Active Workforce Participation\n• Process Safety Indicators that Drive Performance\n• Regulatory Assessment, Verification, and Intervention; and an\n• Independent, Competent, Well-Funded Regulator\nAs will be discussed in Section 5, California’s patchwork of regulations does not effectively implement\nthese features, which are also illustrated in the figure below. Section 4 provides a detailed discussion of\nthese features.\n170 President Barack Obama established the National Commission on the BP Macondo Oil Spill and Offshore\nDrilling through Executive Order 13543 on May 21, 2010, to examine the facts and circumstances concerning the\nroot causes of the Macondo explosion and fire.

The onus is on the duty holder175 to prove to the regulator that the company’s\nprocesses, methodologies used to assess risks, and reasoning for choosing one control over another have\nsubstantially reduced risks to as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP), or equivalent. The duty holder\n175 Duty holders are considered to be “those who create and/or have the greatest control of the risks associated with a\nparticular activity. Those who create the risks at the workplace are responsible for controlling them.” HSE.\nPlanning to do business in the UK offshore oil and gas industry?

The HSE has noted that the safety case report\n“demonstrates that the duty holder has arrangements in place which, if implemented, are capable of\nachieving compliance with legal objectives set out in other [] regulations…[and] provides a\ncomprehensive core document that can be used as a check by both the duty holder and HSE that the\naccepted risk control measures and the health and safety management systems are in place and operate as\nthey should.”177 The HSE has also stated:\n[t]he principal matters to be demonstrated in a safety case are that: a) the\nmanagement system is adequate to ensure compliance with statutory\nhealth and safety requirements; and for management of arrangements\nwith contractors and sub-contractors, b) that adequate arrangements have\nbeen made for audit and for audit reporting, [and] c) that all hazards with\nthe potential to cause a major accident have been identified, their risks\nevaluated, and measures have been, or will be, taken to control those\nrisks to ensure that the relevant statutory provisions will be complied\nwith.178\nThe safety case report must also demonstrate “how inherently\nsafer design concepts have been applied in the design decisions\ntaken.”179 This principle applies to all stages of the\ninstallation’s life cycle, and includes materials selection and\nmanaging corrosion in the design.\nIt is also important to note that safety case reports are meant to\nbe evergreen documents that reflect continuous improvement in\nrisk reduction. For onshore operations in the UK, the duty\nholder is required to review the safety case report during the\nconstruction of a new facility, whenever new facts or technical\nknowledge about safety matters become known, or whenever\nthe operator makes a change to the safety management system that could have significant impacts on the\nprevention of major accidents.180 The duty holder must revise the safety report to ensure that it “remains\nup to date and continues to provide an accurate representation of the major accident hazards…and the\n176 The HSE defines “safety case” as “a document that gives confidence to both the duty holder and HSE that the\nduty holder has the ability and means to control major accident risks effectively.

Following the\nregulator’s acceptance of the safety case report, the duty holder must ensure that the installation is\noperated in conformity with the management system and other provisions described in the safety case.185\nIn the US, facilities commence operation before they are inspected or evaluated for complying with PSM\nor RMP regulations. In fact, the CSB has investigated incidents where the employer disputed that its\nprocess was covered by the PSM standard or RMP regulations. Regulators do not evaluate and approve\nPHAs or other hazard reviews and do not have the authority to license specific facilities for operation,\nbased on the adequacy of their process safety programs. If an operating facility contains processes\ncovered by the PSM standard, the facility must complete primarily activity-based regulatory requirements\nat least once every five years. The employer has no general duty to continually reduce risk. RMP-\ncovered facilities must submit fairly high-level information exhibiting compliance with RMP\nrequirements at least once every five years. While the regulator ensures the RMP has been filed and\ncontains the required sections, there is no analysis of the effectiveness of controls identified in the RMP to\nmitigate hazards.\n4.2 Continuous Risk Reduction to ALARP\nAs discussed above, a majority of the safety case regimes implemented globally impose a duty on owners\nor operators of covered facilities on and offshore to reduce risks to ALARP or equivalent. The Center for\nChemical Process Safety (CCPS) defines ALARP as “a risk reduction goal, where risk reduction efforts\nare continued until the incremental effort to further reduce risk becomes grossly disproportionate to the\nlevel of additional risk reduction.”186 This principle provides the regulator with the main foundation on\n181 The Competent Authority.

In essence, the regulator ultimately determines whether\nALARP has been achieved through the authority to accept or reject the safety case report. An advantage\nof ALARP as opposed to a prescriptive or activity-based approach is that ALARP results in the\ncontinuous reduction of risk to keep up-to-date with advancing technology and industry best practices.187\nAlthough two of the 14 PSM elements (PHA and mechanical integrity) contain performance-based or\ngoal-setting requirements, 188 the PSM standard does not provide a specific risk reduction target such as\nALARP.\nIn reviewing the safety case report, the regulator may accept\nthe application of relevant good practice as a sufficient\ndemonstration of ALARP.189 As the HSE notes, “the\nmeasures in place to prevent or limit major accidents should\nbe described in the safety report and be at least to ‘relevant\ngood practice.’”190 According to Dr. Hopkins, the duty of\nALARP “provides leverage for the regulator…[i]f an\noperator wishes to adopt a procedure or a standard that falls\nshort of good or best practice, the regulator can reject it on\nthe grounds that it does not reduce the risk as low as\nreasonably practicable.”191 As noted above, regulators such\nas HSE provide guidance on what is considered good\npractice, and publish documents containing good practice\nstandards to assist operators with applying this concept.\nHowever, the duty holder must make the case for the standard or practice being utilized, and the regulator\nmay determine that applying good practice alone is not sufficient to demonstrate that risks have been\nreduced to ALARP. In addition, if there is no directly applicable rule or standard, operators still have a\nduty to manage risk, and they therefore must maintain a reasonable level of risk awareness that goes\nbeyond mere compliance.192 This raises a safety case regime above the compliance mentality of a more\nactivity-based regime, such as PSM, and requires the duty-holder and the regulator to continuously ask\nwhether there are other measures that would be effective in further reducing risks.\nThe UK HSE provides ample guidance on determining what is considered to be ALARP, and many\nBritish courts have interpreted the concept as well. In the 1949 case Edwards v. National Coal Board,\ndecided by the Court of Appeal, Judge Asquith wrote:\n‘Reasonably practicable’ is a narrower term than ‘physically possible’\nand seems to me to imply that a computation must be made by the\n187 See http://www.hse.gov.uk/foi/internalops/hid_circs/permissioning/spc_perm_37/ (accessed December 9, 2013).\n188 29 CFR §1910.119(e)(1) requires the employer to “identify, evaluate, and control the hazards involved in the\nprocess.” 29 CFR §1910.119(j)(5) states that “[t]he employer shall correct deficiencies in equipment that are\noutside acceptable limits (defined by the process safety information in paragraph (d) of this section) before further\nuse or in a safe and timely manner when necessary means are taken to assure safe operation.”\n189 HSE.

Risk\nassessment approaches range in order of increasing analytical detail from qualitative, to semi-quantitative, to\nquantitative. Qualitative risk assessment is the simplest approach where judgments about consequence, likelihood,\nand the tolerability of risk are made on a subjective basis using the knowledge and experience of team members and\nmay not be consistently applied within an organization. Semi-quantitative risk assessment is the second level of\nanalytical detail, where organizations develop and provide to team members predetermined risk matrices and\nguidance for establishing numerical consequence and frequency levels. This approach is of greater value to team\nmembers as based upon their collective experience; the team typically has a sense of how frequently an event might\noccur and how great the potential consequence may be within the predetermined ranges. Layer of protection\nanalysis (LOPA) is a semi-quantitative form of risk assessment, using order of magnitude categories for evaluating\nfrequency, consequence, and adequacy of safeguards. Quantitative risk assessment involves the highest level of\nanalytical detail and typically involves specialized expertise to perform. Complex models are commonly developed\nto evaluate frequency, consequence, and the effectiveness of safeguards in a quantitative risk assessment. Such\napproaches are typically standardized to minimize result variability within an organization and even between\norganizations in countries where a quantitative risk assessment is mandated by regulatory authorities.

When the criteria are qualitative, it is more likely that subjective judgments play a large\nrole, but those judgments must be equally recorded.”204\nThere is no corresponding duty to reduce risks to ALARP in the PSM standard or RMP program. Rather,\nthese regulations require that facilities “control” identified hazards, with no further dialogue on how far\nthe operator must go to control those hazards. Neither the facility nor the regulator is required to\ndetermine whether more could be done to control hazards or reduce risks to comply with these\nregulations, and this may result in the implementation of insufficient controls relating to a hazard.\nWhile OSHA and the EPA do rely on general duty standards when implementing the PSM standard and\nthe RMP program, these duties do not drive onshore companies toward reducing the risks of their\nactivities to ALARP, and instead are utilized as enforcement tools typically after an incident has occurred,\nmeant to cover those activities not specifically regulated. These standards may also be used by OSHA or\nEPA to cite a company for not following a specific RAGAGEP for 2 of the 14 process safety elements -\nmechanical integrity and PSI.\nOSHA enforces section 5(a) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHAct), which states the\nfollowing:\n(a) Each employer –\n(1) shall furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of\nemployment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or\nare likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees;\n(2) shall comply with occupational safety and health standards\npromulgated under this act…205\nSection 5(a)(1), also known as OSHA’s General Duty Clause, has been described as a “catch-all”\nprovision meant to fill gaps in OSHA law for recognized unregulated hazards.206,207 In order for OSHA to\n200 Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Storage Act 2006, Volume 3, Schedule 3, Clause 9.\nhttp://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00148/Html/Volume_3#_Toc315688204 (accessed October 30, 2013).\n201 ALARP Guidance Note N-04-300-GN0166, Rev. 3 (Dec. 2011) available at\nhttp://www.nopsema.gov.au/assets/document/N-04300-GN0166-ALARP.pdf (accessed May 15, 2013).\n202 Fasso, Alberto, and Rokni, S.

This is a key feature of the safety case\napproach in preventing major accidents.\nUnder the CAA, the General Duty Clause requires owners and operators “to identify hazards which may\nresult from such releases using appropriate hazard assessment techniques, to design and maintain a safe\nfacility taking such steps as are necessary to prevent releases, and to minimize the consequences of\naccidental releases which do occur.”209 Similar to OSHA, the EPA can use its General Duty Clause\nenforcement authority to create legally binding requirements or enforce actions for hazards that have not\nbeen specifically regulated. The EPA can use this authority proactively (before an incident) or reactively\n(following an incident), and can enforce the clause where it finds the possibility of imminent and\nsubstantial endangerment.210\nAccording to EPA guidance on the RMP program, because it is the owner or operator’s duty to “prevent\naccidents and ensure safety at [their] source…” this may require steps to be taken “beyond those specified\nin the risk management program rule.”211 While this principle appears to be similar to ALARP\nrequirements of the safety case, in practice whether this is done is not subject to regulation or review. In\naddition, it is permissive in that it uses the word “may.” Nothing additional, such as ALARP, is required.\nThis will be addressed below in more detail in the discussion of implementation of the EPA RMP\nprogram in California.\n4.3 Adaptability and Continuous Improvement\nA key strength of the safety case regulatory regime is that it provides the regulator with the tools to drive\ncontinuous improvement among facilities and ensure risks have been reduced to ALARP or equivalent,\nrather than focusing on compliance with activity-based regulatory requirements. Although complying\nwith good practice may achieve ALARP, the regulator also has the ability under this regime to require\nfacilities to go above and beyond good practices and standards to achieve ALARP without requiring\nhttp://www.nsc.org/safetyhealth/Pages/5%2011%20The%20General%20Duty%20Clause.aspx (accessed June 5,\n2013).\n207 According to the National Safety Council, General Duty Clause violations make up only about 1.5 percent of\ntotal violations issued annually by OSHA.

The Baker Panel212 noted in its 2007 report (“the Baker Report”) on BP and its process\nsafety performance following the 2005 BP Texas City disaster that an effective process safety\nmanagement system builds upon an “improvement cycle” that “should include, in practice, continuous\nreduction of process risk and improvements in safety performance according to some measurable\ncriteria.”213\nThe Baker Panel defined “continuous improvement” as\n• improving controls for process hazards, including process safety knowledge\nand competence of workers;\n• improving process safety leadership of supervisors;\n• improving process engineering to identify and then design to remove or\nmitigate the effects of process hazards;\n• going beyond legal compliance to best practices to reduce risks;\n• going beyond mere compliance with internal standards, but learning from\noperating experiences, incident and near miss investigations, hazard studies,\naudits, and other assessments to improve those internal standards; and\n• identifying and implementing not only those external standards that must be\nobserved, but also those that represent best practices that can lead to process\nsafety excellence.214\nAn independent review conducted of the Australian offshore safety case regime in 2000 echoes the\nimportance of continuous improvement in process safety management, stating that “critical to the\nsuccessful implementation of a safety case regime is the achievement of a qualitative shift in industry and\nregulatory safety cultures from the minimalist compliance of the prescriptive regime to the philosophy of\nbest practice and continuous improvement.”215 Recently, Lord Cullen addressed the importance of\nadaptability as well, when he spoke at the 2013 Oil & Gas UK Piper 25 offshore safety conference in\nAberdeen, Scotland.216 In his keynote speech, Lord Cullen quoted the Maitland panel, which examined\nthe UK offshore safety regime after the Macondo incident, noting that “safety cases should be living\ndocuments [emphasis added] central to the way facilities are operated, with contents widely\nunderstood.”217\n212 In the aftermath of the BP Texas City Incident, BP followed the recommendation of the CSB and formed an\nindependent panel known as the Baker Panel to conduct a thorough review of the company’s corporate safety\nculture, safety management systems, and corporate safety oversight at its US refineries.

In light of major accidents\nthat have occurred, such as the BP Texas City explosion and fire which resulted in 15 fatalities, and the\nMotiva Enterprises sulfuric acid tank explosion, which fatally injured one worker and injured eight others,\nthe CSB has made a number of key recommendations to OSHA and the EPA to revise the PSM and RMP\nregulations, respectively. However, agencies have failed to implement these recommendations and these\nregulations have remained static despite the important lessons learned from these incidents. In addition,\nthe OSHA PSM standard’s Appendix A, which contains a list of toxic and reactive highly hazardous\nchemicals and the threshold quantity for each, was originally created using a number of older sources,\nincluding the EPA’s “Extremely Hazardous Substance List,” the 1982 Seveso Directive, the 1984\nCIMAH regulations, and others. A number of these sources have been revised, updated, and amended\nthroughout the years, while Appendix A has not. In fact, no chemicals have been added to either the PSM\nor the RMP programs since the rules were initially adopted in the 1990s, even as numerous serious\nprocess incidents have occurred involving chemicals that were not listed.\nThe U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) published a 2012 report on OSHA’s standard setting\nabilities, and noted that between 1981 and 2010, OSHA took anywhere from 15 months to 19 years to\ndevelop and issue 58 significant safety and health standards (averaging seven years).219 According to the\nreport, OSHA reasoned that it must evaluate technological and economic feasibility of a potential\nstandard using data gathered by visiting worksites in industries that will be affected, on an industry-by-\nindustry basis.220 This was described as “an enormous undertaking because, for example, it requires visits\nto multiple worksites.”221 In addition, Executive Order 12866222 requires that federal agencies, including\nOSHA, provide an assessment of the potential overall costs and benefits for significant rules to the Office\nof Management and Budget (OMB). OSHA will typically be required under the Small Business\nRegulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996223 to initiate a panel process to receive and consider input\n218 5 U.S.C. Chapter 5, sections 511-599, also known as the Administrative Procedure Act, or APA, requires that\nfederal agencies seeking to promulgate a rule or regulation submit to a lengthy notice and comment rulemaking\nprocess that includes publishing the proposed rule making in the Federal Register; providing the public with at least\n30 days to participate in the rulemaking process by submitting written comments or data, and then discussing the\npublic comments and providing a rationale for accepting or rejecting them. The OSHAct Section 6(b) specifies the\nprocedures OSHA must use to promulgate, modify, or revoke its standards (29 U.S.C. §655(b)). These procedures\ninclude publishing the proposed rule in the Federal Register, providing interested persons an opportunity comment,\nand holding a public hearing upon request.\n219 GAO.

The\nrecommendations start on page 89 of the report.\n47\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\nparagraph (j) to cover the mechanical integrity of any safety-critical equipment….”233 However, OSHA\nhas proposed changes to the PSM standard before, with no action ultimately being taken. On April 27,\n1998, OSHA announced that it was considering issuing an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking234\n(ANPRM) “to address issues related to reactive chemicals raised by the explosion of a chemical plant in\nLodi, New Jersey in 1995.”235,236 On May 14, 2001, OSHA clarified its intent to publish an ANPRM “to\naddress the need to add reactive chemicals that are not currently covered by PSM…”237 On December 3,\n2001, however, the entry on reactives was withdrawn from the rulemaking agenda.238 Following the\ndevastating ammonium nitrate explosion on April 17, 2013, in West, Texas, which resulted in at least 14\nfatalities and mass destruction in the town of West, CSB Chairperson Moure-Eraso urged both OSHA and\nthe EPA to expand their standards to include reactive chemicals and hazards such as ammonium nitrate.239\nOn July 25, 2013, the CSB held a public meeting in Washington, DC to discuss the status of key open\nrecommendations the CSB has made to OSHA over the last decade to revise its PSM standard and create\na new combustible dust standard. These recommendations, which include revising the PSM standard to\nrequire MOC reviews for organizational changes such as mergers and acquisitions that may impact\nprocess safety, and ensuring PSM coverage for atmospheric storage tanks that could be involved in a\npotential catastrophic release, have stemmed from major CSB investigations including its BP Texas City,\nMotiva, ConAgra, Kleen, Imperial Sugar, and Hoeganaes investigations, as well as its Combustible Dust\nStudy.240 OSHA’s failure to implement these recommendations, which can be attributed to its lack of\nrulemaking activities over the last decade, led the CSB to reclassify seven key open recommendations as\n“Open-Unacceptable.” The CSB also adopted the OSHA Combustible Dust Standard recommendation as\na CSB “Most Wanted Chemical Safety Improvement.” OSHA formally responded and cited to the GAO\nreport discussed above, noting that on average, it takes OSHA seven years to issue a standard, a process\n233 See OSHA’s rulemaking abstract at\nhttp://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=201304&RIN=1218-AC82 (accessed September 17,\n2013).\n234 Most federal agencies develop rules through “informal rulemaking.” Under the Administrative Procedure Act, or\nAPA, informal rulemaking requires a publication of a “Notice of Proposed Rulemaking” (NPRM) in the Federal\nRegister; opportunity for public participation by submission of written comments; consideration by the agency of the\npublic comments and other relevant material; and publication of a final rule not less than 30 days before its effective\ndate, with a statement explaining the purpose of the rule. Under the APA, an agency may publish an Advance\nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) when the agency wants to test out a proposal or solicit ideas before it\ndrafts its NPRM.

Hence, OSHA reserves rulemaking for “widespread and serious hazards.”\nNeeded petroleum refinery and chemical process safety improvements may never fall under this category.\nOSHA noted at the meeting that it would be utilizing a Request for Information241 (RFI) to aid in the\nrevision of its PSM standard, aimed at addressing a number of issues that have developed in the 21 years\nsince the PSM standard was promulgated in 1992. On December 9, 2013, OSHA published its RFI in the\nFederal Register.242 The RFI requests comment on potential revisions to OSHA’s PSM standard, among\nother regulations. The RFI identifies seventeen topics for potential rulemaking and enforcement changes,\nincluding clarifying the PSM exemption for atmospheric storage tanks and expanding PSM coverage and\nrequirements for reactive hazards. The RFI also cites a number of CSB investigation reports and\nrecommendations, including the CSB Reactive Hazard Study entitled Improving Reactive Hazard\nManagement, the BP Texas City Investigation Report, and the Donaldson Enterprises, Inc., Investigation\nReport.243 Although the RFI is an important opportunity to enhance the dialogue on implementation of\nthe safety case regulatory approach to enhance process safety management and risk reduction in the US, it\ndoes not specifically mention the safety case approach.244\nOn January 3, 2014, OSHA released a response to Section 6(a) of Executive Order 13650,245 which\ntasked the Chemical Facility Safety and Security Working Group, created by the Order and consisting of\nfederal agencies such as OSHA, the EPA, and PHMSA,246 with considering options to improve chemical\nsafety regulation. The document provides separate responses from each member agency of the group, and\nnotes that the group is seeking public input on potential areas where standards could be improved.\nAccording to the document, three agencies – OSHA, the EPA, and PHMSA – have all included\n“[e]valuating the implementation of best practices and lessons learned such as the ‘safety case’ regulatory\n241 An RFI is a tool used by a federal agency to help develop a proposed rule.

OSHA states in this\ndocument that it is seeking public input on potential areas where it could improve its standards, and includes\n“[e]valuating the implementation of best practices and lessons learned such as the ‘safety case’ regulatory model to\nreduce risk in complex industrial processes” as an area to consider.\nhttps://www.osha.gov/chemicalexecutiveorder/Section_6ai_Options_List.html (accessed January 7, 2014).\nHowever, the safety case regulatory model is not mentioned in the RFI that was released for public comment.\n245 This document is available at https://www.osha.gov/chemicalexecutiveorder/Section_6ai_Options_List.html\n(accessed January 7, 2014).\n246 The Chemical Facility Safety and Security Working Group is co-chaired by the Secretary of Homeland Security,\nthe Administrator of the EPA, and the Secretary of Labor. The Working Group must consist of the head or a\ndesignated representative of the Department of Justice, Department of Agriculture, and the Department of\nTransportation. The Working Group must also consult with representatives from the Council on Environmental\nQuality; the National Security Staff; the Domestic Policy Council; the Office of Science and Technology Policy; the\nOffice of Management and Budget; the White House Office of Cabinet Affairs; and other agencies designated by the\nPresident. http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/08/01/executive-order-improving-chemical-facility-\nsafety-and-security (accessed January 13, 2014).\n49\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\nmodel to reduce risk in complex industrial processes” in a preliminary list of options to consider for\nimproving chemical facility and safety.247\nOSHA’s ability to adapt to process safety-related new or revised codes, standards, technology, and\nlessons learned is mainly limited to RAGAGEP requirements, which OSHA included in the mechanical\nintegrity and PSI elements of its PSM standard in part to “provide flexibility for the employer to choose\nthe frequency which would provide the best assurance of equipment integrity.”248 OSHA meant for\nRAGAGEP to include “both appropriate internal standards and applicable codes and standards.…”249\nHowever, the concept of RAGAGEP only applies to 2 of the 14 PSM standard elements (mechanical\nintegrity and PSI),250 only addresses equipment and mechanical integrity, and is usually utilized by\nOSHA as a mechanism to issue citations to companies post-incident.\nIn addition, OSHA has had difficulty enforcing RAGAGEP citations. In a recent OSHA Review\nCommission proceeding, Secretary of Labor v BP Products North America, Inc., & BP-Husky Refining,\nLLC,251 and United Steelworkers Local 1-346, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) vacated OSHA\nRAGAGEP citations issued to BP for violations of 29 CFR §1910.119(d)(3)(ii)252 for failure to comply\nwith a specific RAGAGEP, holding that OSHA impermissibly adopted a specific RAGAGEP, thereby\ndiminishing the performance aspect of the RAGAGEP requirements contained within the OSHA PSM\nstandard. The ALJ concluded that by citing to only one specific RAGAGEP, OSHA impermissibly\nadopted a prescriptive standard; in the ALJ’s view, OSHA should have acknowledged other possible\nRAGAGEPs for BP to comply with, including BP’s own internal standards. If upheld, this ruling may\nlimit OSHA’s ability to utilize RAGAGEP as a means of requiring companies to implement industry\ngood practices in the future.253\nThe cumbersome rulemaking process and lack of flexibility that has resulted in stagnant and static OSHA\nstandards can be contrasted with the structure of the safety case regulatory regime, which facilitates\nadaptability and enables the regulator to improve industry safety performance and practices without\nrequiring a major rule change. The safety case essentially provides the regulator with the tools to\nrecognize more rigorous standards and practices that exist and drive a company to implement those\npractices to further reduce risks, as well as work with industry to improve existing standards and practices\nif necessary. It also enables companies to implement new, more efficient or safer technologies that do not\nnecessarily meet strict prescriptive regulations, but that drive risk reduction.\nThis adaptability is illustrated by the HSE’s recommendations following the 2004 Buncefield incident.\nOn December 11, 2005, a number of explosions occurred at Buncefield Oil Storage Depot in Hemel\nHemptstead, Hertfordshire, England following the overfilling of a gasoline tank. Over 40 people were\ninjured and there was significant offsite damage to homes and businesses. An independently chaired\nMajor Incident Investigation Board led by Lord Newton of Braintree was set up to investigate the\nincident. Between 2006 and 2008 the Board issued a number of reports and recommendations. In the\n247 Ibid.\n248 57 Fed. Reg. 6390-6391 (1992).\n249 Ibid at 6390-6391.\n250 29 CFR §§1910.119(d)(3)(ii) and (j)(4)(ii) and (iii).\n251 BP Products North America, Inc. operates a refinery in Oregon, Ohio.

Ibid at 20.\n260 Ibid at 13.\n261 Between May 29 and June 10, 2000, three incidents occurred at the BP Grangemouth Petrochemical Complex in\nScotland, which is one of the largest of the 950 COMAH sites in the UK.\n262 Available at http://www.hse.gov.uk/comah/guidance/process-safety-performance-indicators.pdf (accessed May\n21, 2013).\n263 COMAH Competent Authority, “Workstream 2e: Process safety performance indicators,” 2012; page 3.\n264 COMAH Competent Authority, “Workstream 2e: Process safety performance indicators,” 2012; page 6.\n265 Ibid at 3.\n51\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\nperformance; and adds that full implementation of this program could take between 18 months and two\nand a half years from when the initial introduction takes place – all without requiring any fundamental\nchanges to the COMAH regulations themselves.\nThe COMAH CA Investigation Team noted in its publication summarizing the conclusions of the\nBuncefield investigation that following the incident, the CA, industry, and trade unions worked together\nto “drive forward high standards at fuel storage sites…[which] has resulted in agreement on improved\nstandards of safety and environmental protection for all UK sites storing large volumes of gasoline and to\nsystematically upgrade sites to meet these standards….”266\nIn another example following the Buncefield incident, the Board recommended significantly higher\nstandards than were generally in place in the sector. For example, the Board recommended that fuel\nstorage tanks be fitted with automatic overfill protection equipment that would cut off supply if an overfill\nevent occurs, rather than continuing to rely on operators to interrupt flow manually in the case of an\nevent. In response, the UK Petroleum Industry Association and the Tank Storage Association adopted the\nrecommendation, and the British government announced that it would require all sites to move to fully\nautomatic shutdown systems on tanks storing gasoline. The Process Safety Leadership Group (PSLG)\nwas formed to help develop the details of the new rule, and to “meet the need for an effective framework\nfor interaction between industry, trade unions and the COMAH Competent Authority (CA).…”267 As\nwill be discussed in the next section, workforce involvement is a key element of an effective safety case\nregulatory regime. In 2009, HSE published the PSLG’s work in a document entitled Safety and\nEnvironmental Standards for Fuel Storage Sites. The document lays out precisely which tanks must\nutilize automatic overfill protection equipment, and also allows for duty holders to demonstrate technical\nreasons as to why automatic overfill protection would not be appropriate by “prepar[ing] a robust\ndemonstration that alternative measures are capable of achieving an equivalent ALARP outcome to an\noverfill protection system that is automatic…”268 This document in essence was developed as an industry\ngood practice, and compliance with its requirements would likely ensure that the duty holder is complying\nwith the law and reducing risks to ALARP.269\nThis can be contrasted with an even larger release of gasoline and a subsequent explosion that occurred in\nthe 2009 tank overfill at the Caribbean Petroleum Corporation near San Juan, Puerto Rico. This incident\nseverely damaged surrounding buildings and impacted moving vehicles. However, the incident has not\nresulted in any re-evaluation of safety rules by the EPA or OSHA, despite the fact that tank terminals\nlargely fall outside the PSM and RMP program regulations, (let alone the more rigorous requirements of a\nmajor hazard safety case regulatory regime, as practiced in the UK).\nThese post-Buncefield examples highlight one of the most important attributes of the safety case\nregulatory approach: it is a regulatory framework that implements a balance of goal-setting and\nprescriptive elements which enable the regulator to drive facilities to continuously improve practices\n266 The Competent Authority.

This flexibility and adaptability encourages facilities to\nfocus on improving practices and technology rather than on completing activity-based requirements,\nwhich can have the effect of stifling innovation and technological advancement.\nCritics argue that because there have been significant industry problems with the maintenance of safety\ncritical equipment and aging equipment in the UK, 270 the safety case regime is not operating effectively.\nRegulators and commissions in the UK have found degradation of pipes, valves, and other equipment at\nmany facilities due to company deferral of maintenance, insufficient testing of safety-critical elements,\nand a continuing industry culture of responding to disasters. However, the HSE has worked to make\nimprovements to these areas. In 2010, the UK HSE initiated Key Programme 4 to address the issue of\naging equipment offshore and the operation of installations beyond their design life.271 The same year,\nthe HSE published a report intended to inform industry and aid in the prevention of major accidents\nentitled Managing Ageing Plant: A Summary Guide,272 which provides an overview of ageing plant\nmechanisms and their management. This document presents analysis and findings for loss of containment\nincidents to demonstrate how aging plant equipment may be a factor. The HSE has been able to take this\ntype of programmatic proactive approach in the UK thanks to the safety case regime’s adaptive nature,\nwhich is lacking in the US both on and offshore. This is positive evidence of a competent and effective\nregulator with the tools under the safety case regime to identify and proactively address industry gaps in\nsafety performance.\n4.4 Active Workforce Participation\nAs the CSB noted in its Interim Report on the Chevron incident, workforce participation is a key element\nof process safety and effective major accident prevention. In one of its publications, the Center for\nChemical Process Safety (CCPS) lists workforce involvement as one of 20 essential management\ncomponents necessary to reduce process safety risks and prevent chemical accidents.273 According to\nCCPS,\n…workers are potentially the most knowledgeable people with respect to\nthe day-to-day details of operating the process and maintaining the\nequipment and facilities and may be the sole source for some types of\nknowledge gained through their unique experiences. Workforce\ninvolvement provides management a mechanism for tapping into this\nvaluable expertise.274\nThis CCPS publication discusses general areas of workforce involvement in risk assessments, inspections,\naudits, and performance reviews, and notes that participation leads to empowerment, management\n270 The HSE published a report to communicate the results and conclusions of the Asset Integrity Key Programme\ncarried out between 2004 and 2007 by the Health and Safety Executive’s Offshore Division. See\nhttp://www.hse.gov.uk/offshore/kp3.pdf, (accessed August 28, 2013).\n271 The UK launches Key Programmes to address poor performance in specific areas.

For example, as will be discussed in the next section on\nperformance indicators, the CSB recommended in its BP Texas City Final Investigation Report that BP\nand the United Steelworkers Union (USW) establish a joint program to report incidents and near misses,\nand to ensure that recommendations made during investigations were implemented. The CSB also\nrecommended that API and the USW work together to develop a safety standard addressing leading and\nlagging process safety indicators.278 However, representatives from the USW have stated to the CSB that\nit is a constant struggle for workers and their representatives to have a voice or play a role in the\nmanagement of safety in US petroleum refineries.\nThe law in the UK also requires employers to consult with their employees or their safety representatives\non health and safety matters. The Safety Representatives and Safety Committees Regulations 1977 and\nthe Health and Safety (Consultation with Employees) Regulations 1996 set out the legal framework for\nsuch consultation and worker involvement at both unionized and non-unionized onshore facilities.279\nHowever, these regulations go further than the OSHA PSM standard in that they provide for the election\nof safety representatives by the workers to serve many health and safety-related functions, including\ninvestigating complaints and accidents and carrying out inspections. In his keynote speech at the Oil and\nGas UK Piper 25 conference, Lord Cullen stated that the safety representative positions have “important\nfunctions, such as the power to carry out investigations and reporting safety concerns to management,\nwithout fear of recrimination,” noting that they “help[] reinforce the principle that each employee is\nresponsible for his own safety.”280 The regulations also require employers to establish a safety committee\nwhen one is requested by at least two health and safety representatives. The 1996 regulations require\nemployers to consult with employees not represented by safety representatives under the 1977\n275 Ibid at 125.\n276 29 CFR §1910.119(c) (2012).\n277 See OSHA CPL 02-02-045.

September 16, 2013.\nhttp://www.findingpetroleum.com/n/Review_Lord_Cullen_what_have_we_learned_from_Piper_Alpha/044b5113.as\npx (accessed September 16, 2013).\n54\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\nRegulations on a number of health and safety-related matters, such as the introduction of any measure\nwhich may substantially affect their health and safety at work, the planning and organization of health and\nsafety training, and the health and safety consequences of introducing new technology.281 The law in the\nUK protects employees from being penalized for taking part in health and safety consultation.282\nThe UK’s existing regulations and policies regarding worker involvement offshore were developed and\nstrengthened as a result of the Piper Alpha incident. In the Piper Alpha Report, Lord Cullen emphasized\nthe importance of workforce involvement in safe operations, and noted that a safety committee system is\n“the most visible instrument for the involvement of the workforce in safety.”283 He concluded by\nrecommending that “the regulatory body, operators and contractors should support and encourage the\ninvolvement of the offshore workforce in safety.”284 The HSE developed guidance in response to Lord\nCullen’s recommendations entitled Play your part! How offshore workers can help improve health and\nsafety, intended to encourage workforce participation offshore.285 The most current version of this\nguidance document, which was prepared by the Workforce Involvement Group,286 located within the\nHSE’s Offshore Industry Advisory Committee,287 utilizes good practice and examples of successful\nworkforce involvement in improving health and safety with the goal of assisting operators, contractors,\nsafety representatives, and others in effectively utilizing workforce involvement in their workplaces. It\nencourages companies to facilitate workforce involvement by providing information, improving\ncommunication at all levels, good training, and ensuring that all workers are represented in the decisions\nthat affect them.288\nThe Piper Alpha incident also resulted in the swift development of the SI971 Offshore Regulations\n(Safety Representatives and Safety Committees) Regulations 1989 (“the SI971 Regulations”), which\nprovide for the nomination and election of safety representatives and require offshore installations to\nestablish safety committees.289290 The HSE has published a guidance document entitled A guide to the\n281 See HSE.

The document explains that although the primary responsibility for\nhealth and safety resides with the duty holder, “all members of the workforce must play their part if risks\nare to be eliminated or minimized.”292 It also emphasizes the importance of training of safety\nrepresentatives, which enables them to effectively represent workers and fulfill their responsibilities and\nfunctions under these Regulations.\nIn April 2010, the HSE launched an inspection project to examine the effectiveness of the SI971\nRegulations and the effectiveness of those regulations, as well as to collect examples of best practice to\npresent to the offshore industry.293 Forty-one inspections were completed in a six-month period on\noffshore installations operated by 25 different duty holders. The project helped focus on the power of\nsafety representatives and how to strengthen their ability to effectively perform their duties. It also was\nwell-received by the safety representatives, as it gave them encouragement and recognition, and sent a\nmessage to management on the importance of SI971 and the key role of\nsafety representatives and committees in workplace health and safety.\nThe HSE has placed great emphasis and importance on the role of\nworker involvement and consultation in improving workplace health\nand safety and reducing major accidents on and offshore. In June 2009,\nHSE launched a new strategy entitled Be part of the solution, which\nlists workforce involvement as one of its main priorities, and the\nagency has published a significant amount of guidance on worker\ninvolvement and consultation on its website.294\nThe Norwegian Working Environment Act addresses the rights and\nduties of safety representatives and committees in Norway. It applies\nto nearly all workers in Norway, including onshore and offshore oil\nworkers. The Act provides for the election of government recognized safety representatives whose duty\nis to “safeguard the interests or employees in matters of the working environment.”295 These\nregular basis or following an incident. According to HSE, “this can be of great benefit to the duty holder because it\nbrings an independent look at health and safety factors from the workforce viewpoint.

Each entity provides unique and essential insights,\nand removing the participation of these entities removes a critical voice in health and safety matters. In\nthe UK and Norway, tripartite systems consisting of industry, the regulator, and the workforce have been\nestablished to deal with safety and health issues at the highest levels beyond just site workforce\nrepresentation.\nThe CSB investigation staff has had extensive discussions with worker representatives who have voiced\ntheir opinions on their systems to the CSB. Roy Furre, a Representative from the Norwegian Union of\nEnergy Workers, spoke at the CSB’s 2010 public hearing on the Regulatory Approaches to Offshore Oil\nand Gas Safety, and stated that the Norwegian working environment and the accompanying petroleum\nregulations empower unions and safety delegates in all phases of the petroleum activities.298 He also\nnoted that the Norwegian petroleum regulations require that all necessary information about risks and\ndecisions be given to the workers’ representatives.299 During the CSB’s public hearing on Safety\nPerformance Indicators in July 2012, Jake Molloy, the Regional Organizer for the National Union of Rail,\nMaritime and Transport Workers in the UK, stated that the input of workers is “crucial” in major accident\nprevention and that “if the people operating these systems and delivering these results are unable for any\nreason to tell you what the true picture is, everything else is worthless.”300 When speaking at a “Step\nChange for Safety” Conference in Aberdeen, Scotland, on September 5, 2012, Mr. Molloy noted that\nattending the public hearing in Houston was “eye opening” and that hearing about the US system was like\na “walk back in time.”301\n296 Ibid at Section 6-2.

Process safety indicators are a\nsignificant element of process safety management systems. They\nmeasure the strengths and weaknesses of these systems to achieve and\nmaintain safe and reliable operations302 and, if properly defined, collected\nand used, can identify the successes and flaws of the system.303\nLagging indicators are a “form of reactive monitoring”304 that includes\nevents such as major spills, fires, or gas releases. Leading indicators, on\nthe other hand, are a “form of active monitoring,”305 and are described as events that do not result in\nsevere consequences and usually address safety system performance, such as deviations from safe\noperating limits or timely maintenance on safety critical equipment.306 Leading indicators “can be\nconsidered as measures of process or inputs essential to deliver the desired safety outcome.”307 The\ngeneral thinking globally is that if companies rely primarily on lagging indicator data, which is\nretrospective, they are not effectively managing process safety to ensure major accidents are prevented.\nAccording to the HSE, “[t]oo many organizations rely heavily on failure data to monitor performance, so\nimprovements or changes are only determined after something has gone wrong. Discovering weaknesses\nin control systems by having a major incident is too late and too costly.”308 Rather, facilities must\nidentify critical controls to monitor and set leading indicators against each one to show that the system is\noperating as intended.\nThe HSE was one of the earliest regulators to adopt process safety indicators regulations. In 1995, the\nagency began requiring companies to report health and safety data, and then published annual reports\nbased on those statistics. In 2006, the HSE developed a step-by-step guidance document entitled\nDeveloping process safety indicators309 to assist industry. The guide establishes and discusses in detail\nsix main steps necessary to implement a process safety measurement system, including developing\nleading and lagging indicators. It also defines leading and lagging indicators for each of the controls in\nthe risk control system. According to Jake Molloy, “[i]t is our firm belief that the most influential and\n302 CCPS.

In response to recommendations stemming from such\nincidents, the COMAH CA developed an Operational Delivery Guide in 2010 on process safety\nperformance indicators setting out four stages to aid facilities in the development of process safety\nindicators. The document sets out a goal that by the end of 2015 major hazard establishments and duty\nholders will measure their safety performance and control of risk by way of key leading and lagging\nperformance indicators.\nFollowing the 2005 BP Texas City incident, BP developed company-wide process safety indicators, and\nnow includes process safety metrics in performance contracts for its US refinery managers.311 However,\nexisting guidance in the US pertaining to safety performance indicators does not adequately aid\ncompanies in managing major hazards onshore. The CSB has noted that in virtually every incident it\ninvestigates in the US, process safety indicators are either not used at all or not used effectively.312\nMillions of workplaces around the US primarily measure their safety performance using OSHA\nrecordable injury and illness rates, which include slips, trips, and falls. While collecting this type of data\nis also necessary in hazardous operations, it is not sufficient. Injury rates do not depict the effectiveness\nof a high hazard facility’s process safety management program.313 For example, the CSB noted in its BP\nTexas City investigation that BP’s personal injury metrics were described as being at the best level on\nrecord; yet, around this same time, in March 2005, BP Texas City experienced the devastating 15-fatality\nincident, which resulted from a progressive erosion of process safety performance that was not reflected\nin injury statistics.\nFollowing the BP Texas City incident, a number of key recommendations were made to strengthen\nguidance on indicators in the US. For example, the Baker Panel314 issued the Baker report, which\nrecommended the incorporation of safety indicators to measure safety performance, and stated:\nThe Panel believes that relying exclusively or predominantly on lagging\nindicators to assess process safety performance is ill-advised. … BP’s\nreliance on lagging, after-the-fact indicators of process safety\nperformance rather than leading, predictive measures…impaired BP’s\nability to measure, monitor and detect deteriorating or degraded process\nsafety conditions and performance… This failure to use a set of effective\nperformance metrics that includes leading indicators increased the\n310 Molloy Testimony.

For a copy of their findings\nand recommendations see\nhttp://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/SP/STAGING/local_assets/assets/pdfs/Bak\ner_panel_report.pdf (accessed August 13, 2013).\n59\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\nlikelihood that the organisation would identify the need for\nimprovements or additional controls only after something had gone\nwrong.315\nThe Baker Panel also noted that it was not enough just to develop process indicators: these indicators\nneeded to be meaningful to the company. As such, the Baker Panel also recommended that “a significant\nproportion of total compensation of refining line managers and supervisors [be] contingent on\nsatisfactorily meeting process safety performance goals….”316\nIn its final investigation report on the incident, the CSB made a recommendation to API and the USW to\njointly lead development of a consensus standard for leading and lagging process safety indicators to\ndrive performance improvements in the prevention of major incidents. API responded by issuing RP 754,\nProcess Safety Performance Indicators for the Refining and Petrochemical Industries. However, this\nvoluntary standard, which defines a framework of four tiered indicators that incorporate the concepts of\nlagging to leading measures, has significant shortcomings, as the CSB described in a two-day public\nhearing on Safety Performance Indicators that was held in July 2012. The CSB analysis found that the\nability of RP 754 to drive performance improvement and inform key stakeholders will be hampered by\n• lagging indicators with insufficient statistical rigor needed to allow for trending or incremental\nperformance improvements;\n• the lack of well-defined standardized and normalized leading indicators that are needed for\ncomparison among sites, corporations, or to national averages;\n• weak employee protection requirements; public reporting requirements that will be ineffective to\nadequately inform stakeholders; and\n• the lack of broadly based consensus in the standard’s development process.317\nAs a result, in 2012 the CSB Board designated the response to the CSB’s recommendation as “open-\nacceptable,”318 meaning that the recommendations recipient is moving in the right direction, but more\nremains to be done.\nThe CSB also noted in the Chevron Interim Report the important role the public plays in monitoring\nsafety management systems, and referenced CCPS as promoting the sharing of process safety indicators\nwith the public:\nSharing performance metrics and results broadly can engage the public\nas a partner in holding the organization accountable for process safety\nperformance. Making metrics and performance public can be an\nespecially powerful way of maintaining upper management commitment\nsince it will likely be the CEO or other senior managers who will be\ncalled to account by the public if goals are not met or performance\ndeclines. Communicating process safety successes also demonstrates to\n315 Baker, J.

The PSA utilizes the indicators data found in these reports to identify critical\nsafety areas that must be targeted for improvement in order to prevent near misses and accidents.320 The\nonshore report, Risk level in the petroleum industry, Onshore facilities,321, 322 includes a description and\nexplanation of the indicators collected and analysis of these data. In this report the PSA notes a\ndecreasing trend in the number of reported hydrocarbon leaks on offshore production facilities between\n2007 and 2010.323 However, it is too soon for PSA to assess trends in the onshore indicators data,\nbecause the time period for onshore data collection has been relatively short and there are fewer data\npoints with only eight facilities onshore. The PSA also indicated that it will take time for the onshore\ndata to improve as indicators are refined, but recognized that the same approach has already yielded\ngood results in the offshore sector.324 Additional information on data and trends based on safety case\nregime implementation are provided in Appendix C.\n319 Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS).

According to the HSE, “[t]he assessment process is\nonly a part of the COMAH regime and examines at face value\nthe factual information and examines arguments and\ndemonstrations contained in the report against the requirements\nof the regulations.”326 The HSE places great emphasis during\nthe assessment phase on the adoption of inherently safer\ndesigns327 and notes that “[m]ajor accident hazards should be\navoided or reduced at source through the application of\nprinciples of inherent safety.”328 Conclusions on the adequacy of the safety case report are developed at\nthe end of the assessment process, and, if deficiencies are found, an intervention strategy for the facility is\ndeveloped to addresses those deficient measures. According to the HSE, assessment of a safety case\nreport or document “is not a discrete activity but leads to further action under the intervention plan for the\noperator at that establishment.”329 Intervention by the regulator ensures that the facility and its operations\nare consistent with information provided in the safety case report, and that there are robust systems in\nplace to “reduce the likelihood of hazards and to mitigate their consequences until the associated risks are\nALARP.”330,331 Under the safety case regulatory regime, the regulator has the authority to accept the\nsafety case report or reject it and require additional measures to further reduce risks.\nPreventative inspections and audits by a technically competent regulator can also result in deep challenges\nto industry, which does not typically happen under the PSM or RMP regulations.

NOPSEMA states that it conducts at least two per year for each normally\nmanned offshore installation.341 NOPSEMA distinguishes between two types of planned inspections:\nfield-based inspections, which focus on implementation of control measures described in a facility’s\nsafety case, and themed audits, which deal with inspection of organizational issues by following a\ncommon theme to direct lines of questioning.342\nIn a 1992 compliance directive,343 OSHA stated that the primary enforcement model for the PSM\nstandard would be planned, comprehensive, and resource-intensive Program Quality Verification (PQV)\ninspections.344 These inspections consist of three parts: determining if the elements of a PSM program\nare in place; evaluating if the programs comply with the requirements of the standard; and verifying\ncompliance with the standard through interviews, data sampling, and field observations. However,\nOSHA does not make planned inspections, which have the most opportunity for prevention, a high\npriority. Rather, OSHA lists its inspection priorities as 1) imminent danger situations; 2) fatalities and\ncatastrophes; 3) complaints; 4) referrals; 5) follow-ups; and 6) planned inspections.345\nThe CSB noted in its BP Texas City Final Investigation Report that for the 10-year period prior to the\nTexas City incident, federal OSHA had conducted no planned PQV inspections in oil refineries. As a\nresult, CSB recommended in its report that OSHA strengthen the planned enforcement of the OSHA\nProcess Safety Management (PSM) standard by developing more highly trained and experienced\ninspectors to conduct more comprehensive inspections, such as the PQV audits envisioned in the 1992\ndirective, at facilities presenting the greatest risk of a catastrophic accident. The intent of the\nrecommendation was to establish a permanent, ongoing planned comprehensive inspections program.\nSpurred in part by the CSB’s recommendations, OSHA issued the Petroleum Refinery Process Safety\nManagement National Emphasis Program (NEP) on June 7, 2007.346 The NEP was a federal program that\nestablished guidelines for inspecting petroleum refineries to assure compliance with the PSM standard.\nUnlike the PQV approach to inspections, which “employs a broad, open-ended inspection strategy and\nuses a more global approach to identify compliance deficiencies…,” the NEP “provide[d] a specific tool\nto evaluate compliance with the [PSM] standard…[which] identifies a particular set of requirements from\nthe PSM standard from which CSHOs [Compliance Safety and Health Officers] are to review documents,\n339 NOPSEMA.

However, the\ninspections being conducted pursuant to the NEP were ended in 2011 partly because they were very time-\nconsuming and resource-intensive.348 OSHA has publicly stated349 that NEP inspection hours were\nroughly 40 times greater than average OSHA inspection hours. OSHA described the NEP as its most\neffective emphasis program in its history, citing a disturbing number of issues and subsequent citations.\nIn 1999, EPA established an audit350 program to help ensure compliance with the RMP program. The\naudits were intended to provide an independent verification of the information in the RMP and include\non-site inspections. Under these requirements, the implementing agency (EPA or a correlating state\nagency) must “periodically audit” RMPs to review their adequacy and require revisions when necessary\nto ensure compliance. 351\nBetween fiscal years (FYs) 2010 and 2012, each EPA Region responsible for implementing the RMP\nprogram was mandated by EPA to perform inspections352 at five percent of the total number of regulated\nfacilities in the regions, and a certain percentage of these facilities were required to be high-risk.353 In FY\n347 CPL 03-00-004, Section X(D)(1). 2007.\n348 Jordan Barab, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health, stated the following\nduring a symposium at the Mary K O’Connor Process Safety Center: “As our refinery NEP comes to an end, we are\nengaged in a process of trying to figure out how we will address refinery PSM issues in the future. Clearly OSHA's\npast practice of targeting inspection according to injury and illness numbers is not adequate. However, because of\nresource limitations, we are also unable to commit to a full-time NEP.” “Saving Lives and Transforming\nWorkplaces: OSHA and Process Safety.” Remarks for Jordan Barab, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Labor for\nOccupational Safety and Health.

RMP audits will generally\ninvolve on-site verification of a facility’s underlying risk management program. Section 68.220 of the RMP rule\nrequires implementing agencies to select facilities for audits based on specific criteria, and to follow a specific\nprocess for resolving audit findings prior to any enforcement action. See EPA. Guidance for Conducting Risk\nManagement Program Inspections under Clean Air Act Section 112(r); January 2011; p 4. Available at\nhttp://www.epa.gov/osweroe1/docs/chem/clean_air_guidance.pdf (accessed June 11, 2013).\n351 40 CFR §68.220 (1999).\n352 RMP inspections “are different from audits in that facilities are not necessarily selected for inspection based on\nPart 68 regulatory criteria, and inspections can lead directly to implementing agency enforcement actions for\nregulatory violations. Also, RMP inspections always involve on-site verification activities.” See EPA, “Guidance\nfor Conducting Risk Management Program Inspections under Clean Air Act Section 112(r).” January 2011; page 4.\nAvailable at http://www.epa.gov/osweroe1/docs/chem/clean_air_guidance.pdf (accessed June 11, 2013).\n353 Criteria used to determine high-risk includes the number of people in the footprint (if it is more than 100,000);\naccidental releases reported in the RMP; the hazard index (percentage of chemical quantity above threshold and\nnumber of chemicals onsite); and the number of Program Levels 2 or 3.

As mentioned above in Section 3.2.2.3.2, the EPA Office of Inspector\nGeneral (OIG) concluded in 2009 that over half of the RMP-covered facilities identified in the US as\nhigh-risk356 had never received an on-site inspection or audit, and over 65 percent of all active RMP\nfacilities had not received an on-site inspection or audit since inception of the RMP program in 1999.357\nThe EPA OIG also noted that of the 296 uninspected high-risk facilities managed by EPA, 151 of these\ncould each impact 100,000 people or more in a worst-case accident scenario.358\n4.7 Independent, Competent, Well-Funded Regulator\nAs noted by NOPSEMA, a safety regulator “provides ‘independent’ assurance to society, governments\nand industry that companies have identified the risks to health and safety and have put appropriate\nmeasures in place to control these risks.”359 To ensure that companies are managing risks and employing\nthe best available standards and technologies, the regulator must be independent,360 well-resourced, and\nretain a sufficient number of technically competent, experienced, and well-trained staff that can critically\nassess companies’ safety case reports and performance. Without independent and competent\nexaminations, the safety case report becomes a meaningless document in terms of controlling risk and\npreventing major accidents. Offshore regulators in the UK and Australia also utilize independent third\nparty specialist safety companies recognized by the regulator. Third party inspectors review important\naspects of the safety case, such as safety critical elements361 and performance standards.362 Third party\ninspections, however, do not take the place of rigorous inspections by the regulator.\n354 EPA OIG.

Lauder, Bob. Major Hazard\n(Asset Integrity) Key Performance Indicators in use in the UK Offshore Oil and Gas Industry. Paper at the CSB\nIndicators Public Hearing. July 24, 2012.\n66\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\nAs of June 2012, the HSE employed roughly 3,300 staff, of which 1,381were front-line inspectors,363\nwhose responsibilities include conducting preventative inspections of roughly 950 COMAH facilities\nthroughout the UK. The HSE employs roughly 105 inspectors to inspect approximately 300 offshore\ninstallations, in effect a one to three ratio. As such, the HSE, with a budget of roughly $472 million,364\nhas the authority to offer higher specialist salaries to attract and retain more experienced, competent\npersonnel. According to information obtained from the HSE, in 2011 and 2012 their onshore specialist\ninspector pay ranged from $85,806 to $102,344, and their offshore inspector pay ranged from $134,387 to\n$148,423 at the highest grade and $116,288 to $131,499 at the next highest grade.365\nA safety case regime requires regulators to conduct preventative facility inspections and audits against the\nsafety case to ensure that specified controls are functioning as intended. Regulators must be capable of\ninteracting as equals with company risk managers when conducting these inspections. Former HSE staff\nhave communicated to the CSB that the HSE seeks new employees with good communication skills in\naddition to education and experience, as the job of a safety case regulator requires encouraging companies\nto aspire to make safety improvements that they may not want to make. One message that current and\nformer HSE staff have repeated is that the industry believes having competent regulatory staff adds\nsignificant value to their business.366 In any country, competent offshore regulatory staff can persuade\ncompanies to manage risks in a rigorous manner, knowing that if not done properly, their risk\nmanagement practices will be challenged.367 This competence is also essential for companies’ confidence\nin the accuracy of the regulatory staff’s advice, inspections, and citations. According to a literature\nreview on the safety case in the UK, “[s]ome companies see as positive the requirement to have ‘someone\nexternal to the company keeping you on your toes by regularly asking if you have done all you can,’ and\nthat it ‘forces you to convince yourself’ that you have covered all the risks.”368\n362 In the UK, duty holders have a duty under the Offshore Installations (Safety Case) Regulations 2005 to “put in\nplace and keep under continual review a verification scheme by means of which assurance is obtained from an\nindependent competent person (ICP) that safety critical elements and PFEER [Offshore Installations ) Prevention of\nFire and Explosion, and Emergency Response] specified plant are suitable and remain suitable for the lifetime of the\ninstallation.” See http://www.hse.gov.uk/offshore/verification.htm (accessed November 14, 2013).\n363 HSE.

Literature Review on the Perceived Benefits and Disadvantages of UK Safety Case\nRegimes; 2003; p 40.\n67\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\nIn the US, the federal government has used extensive resources to retain the best available talent to focus\non health and safety oversight of US commercial and defense nuclear facilities.369 For instance, many\nnonsupervisory technical staff at the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission370 (NRC) and the Defense\nNuclear Facilities Safety Board are paid at the top of the General Schedule pay schedule.371 Virtually all\ntechnical staff at the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board hold technical master’s degrees and\napproximately 25 percent hold doctoral degrees.372\nThe federal government has a unique category of non-executive positions that involve high-level research\nand development in the physical, biological, medical, or engineering sciences, or a closely-related field.373\nThese are known as “Scientific or Professional” positions, and they are classified above the highest\ngeneral schedule pay level.374 These special salary authorizations contribute to the technical agencies’\nability to compete with private industry to recruit and retain highly competent staff. The NRC also has a\ntype of funding mechanism that ensures that the agency’s budget adequately covers its regulator\nactivities, as the NRC is required by law to recover at least 90 percent of its budget through licensing and\ninspection fees.375\nAnother method by which the NRC is able to attract and retain competent technical staff is its extensive\ntraining programs. For new inspection staff, the NRC requires a series of courses, assessments, and\nsimulation, all of which takes approximately two years to complete.376 Inspectors must have a bachelor’s\ndegree in engineering or a degree in a relevant scientific field and Professional Engineer certification.377\nThe agency operates a technical training center in Chattanooga, Tennessee, with various control room\nsimulators that mirror licensees’ facilities. The NRC staff is expected to sufficiently understand this\nequipment so that they are able to conduct sufficient audits and investigations.378 Before he or she is fully\nqualified to conduct inspections, inspector candidates must be recommended by the NRC inspector\nqualification board and certified by the regional administrator or division director.379\nAs will be discussed in greater detail under Section 5.0, at the time of the Chevron incident, a majority of\nthe regulators responsible for oversight of Chevron and other petroleum refineries in California did not\nhave sufficient, sustainable funding or staffing to oversee major accident prevention activities.

This regulatory framework does not foster continuous improvement by driving\ncompanies to reduce risks of their hazardous activities to ALARP, nor does it have the requisite number\nof regulatory staff with the skills, knowledge, and experience to provide sufficient oversight.\n5.1 Cal/OSHA\n5.1.1 Background Information\nSection 18 of the OSHAct380 encourages states to develop and implement their own job safety and health\nprograms. Twenty-five states (including California), Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands currently\nimplement OSHA-approved State Plans.381 States must set job safety and health standards that are “at\nleast as effective as” comparable federal standards; most adopt standards that are identical to the federal\nstandards.382\nCalifornia was certified as an OSHA State Plan state on August 12, 1977.383 California’s Division of\nOccupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) administers the California Occupational Safety and Health\nProgram. A PSM District Office384 within Cal/OSHA enforces California’s PSM standard, which is\nestablished under Title 8, Section 5189 of the California Code of Regulations (CCR) and entitled Process\nSafety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials.385,386 The PSM District Office is comprised of\nseven inspectors, known as Associate Safety Engineers, and one District Manager to regulate nearly 1,700\nPSM-covered facilities in California, including 14 petroleum refineries. Only one of these individuals has\na technical background, with a degree in Chemical Engineering. Appendix B of this report summarizes\nthe key differences between the federal and California PSM standards and the safety case regulatory\nregime. A more detailed analysis of those differences will be provided in the remainder of Section 5.1.\nThe CSB in its Interim Report identified a number of weaknesses of Chevron’s process safety\nperformance. In many of these causal issues, Chevron was not required to perform at a more effective\nlevel by the existing California PSM regulations. In Table 1 below, the CSB identifies the causal issues\nor findings, which highlight the gaps in the California and federal PSM regulations, and how each issue is\nmore effectively managed in the safety case regulatory regime. In this section of the report, some of these\nexamples will be examined in relation to key features of an effective regulatory approach such as the\n380 29 U.S.C. §667 (2004).\n381 These are referred to informally as OSHA State Plans.

CSB Causal Findings.\n5.1.2 Analysis\n5.1.2.1 ALARP\nUnlike the OSHAct, the California Occupational Safety and Health Act does not have a General Duty\nClause. Rather, Section 5189 was established to “eliminate to a substantial degree, the risks to which\nemployees are exposed in petroleum refineries, chemical plants and other facilities.”393 By focusing on\nthe significant reduction of risk, this language supports the principle of ALARP, which requires a\nshowing by the company that “there are no other practical measures that could reasonably be taken to\nreduce risks further.”394 However, this section, which lays out the “scope and purpose” of the regulation,\nis not an enforceable element of the regulation that is subject to citations, and the remaining PSM\nregulation elements do not lead in practice to that result. Rather, California’s PSM standard has remained\nactivity-based, with many activity-based elements almost identical to the federal PSM standard. For\nexample, an employer must “perform a hazard analysis [PHA] appropriate to the complexity of the\n393 8 CCR §5189 (a) (2012).\n394 ALARP Guidance Note N-04-300-GN0166, Rev. 3 (Dec. 2011) available at\nhttp://www.nopsema.gov.au/assets/document/N-04300-GN0166-ALARP.pdf (accessed May 15, 2013).\n76\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\nprocess for identifying, evaluating, and controlling hazards involved in the process....”395 The PHA must\naddress hazards of the process; engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards and their\nrelationships; consequences of failure of these controls; facility siting; human factors; a qualitative\nevaluation of a range of the possible safety and health effects of the failure of controls on facility\nemployees; and the identification of any previous incident which had a likely potential for catastrophic\nconsequences in the workplace.”396 This language does not support the principle of ALARP, and makes\nno mention of risk or continuous improvement in any way. As a result, PHAs satisfy the California PSM\nregulatory requirement by merely listing safeguards; there is no requirement to evaluate or document the\neffectiveness of these safeguards, or to show that the safeguards in place are effectively reducing risks.\nAs discussed in the CSB’s Interim Report on the Chevron incident, Chevron cited in its 2009 crude unit\nPHA non-specific, judgment-based qualitative safeguards such as: utilizing metallurgy to minimize\ncorrosion, having effective maintenance and inspection programs, and providing pipe wall corrosion\nallowances.397 The effectiveness of these safeguards was neither evaluated nor documented. Had the\nadequacy of these safeguards been verified, improved safeguards intended to protect against sulfidation-\ninduced failure of carbon steel piping could have been recommended. In addition, while the 4-sidecut\nline was analyzed in this PHA, corrosion was not identified as a potential cause of a leak/rupture in the\npiping (emphasis added). A corrosion review, also referred to as a damage mechanism hazard review,\nanalyzes hazards presented by all process failure mechanisms such as corrosion and cracking. This type\nof review, while considered to be good practice,398 is not required by the PSM regulations either federally\nor in California, and as such the CSB made a recommendation in its Interim Report to require these in\nfuture California PHAs. Under a safety case regulatory regime, the regulator has the ability to drive\nindustry to adapt new technologies and safer practices as soon as they are developed; new rulemaking is\nnot required for immediate improvements, because companies are obligated to continually work toward\nspecified performance goals such as reducing risks to ALARP. Therefore, under a safety case regulatory\nregime the regulator could require these types of reviews to be conducted to reduce risk without requiring\nadditional legislation.\nCal/OSHA does not typically review a company’s PHA as part of its routine oversight of process safety\nmanagement unless there is a specific complaint, accident, or targeted inspection. Nor does it “accept” a\ncompany’s PHA and proposed hazard mitigations. Therefore, prior to the August 2012 incident,\nCal/OSHA inspectors did not require any additional information or analysis to be provided in the Chevron\ncrude unit PHA. Highlighting the reactive nature of the PSM standard, Cal/OSHA inspected the Chevron\nfacility post-incident and issued 17 citations related to the incident and eight additional citations, with a\ntotal proposed fine of nearly $1 million. Only one citation related to PHAs, and it was not associated with\nevaluating the effectiveness of safeguards or failure to control the 4-sidecut corrosion hazard. Rather, the\nemphasis was that Chevron’s PHA did not adequately account for hazards caused by other units\n395 8 CCR §5189 (e)(1) (2012).\n396 8 CCR §5189 (e)(2) (A) through (G) (2012).\n397 Corrosion allowance refers to extra wall thickness added as a safety factor to the design of a piece of equipment\nbeyond that needed solely for mechanical considerations such as design temperature and pressure. This extra\nthickness is provided to accommodate for expected loss of wall thickness due to corrosion over the life of the\nequipment.\n398 API RP 571, Damage Mechanisms Affecting Fixed Equipment in the Refining Industry, describes common\nprocess failure mechanism and is considered to be good practice for analyzing risks presented by process failure\nmechanisms such as corrosion and cracking.\n77\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\nassociated with the crude unit. This again highlights the lack of a requirement for Chevron to\ndemonstrate that risks have been reduced to ALARP, or for Chevron to provide this type of analysis to\nCal/OSHA to review.\n5.1.2.2 Adaptability and Continuous Improvement\nOf the 25 Cal/OSHA citations mentioned above, two were issued to Chevron for its failure to follow API\nRP 939-C, Guidelines for Avoiding Sulfidation (Sulfidic) Corrosion Failures in Oil Refineries as\nRAGAGEP. This voluntary API standard will be discussed in greater detail in the CSB’s Final\nInvestigation Report on the Chevron incident. However, it is important to note for purposes of this report\nthat API RP 939-C is a permissive and voluntary standard merely intended to provide guidance to\nindustry personnel on how to address sulfidation corrosion in petroleum refining operations. Existing\nsafety guidelines use words “shall” and “should” to denote either requirements or recommendations. API\nRP 939-C does not use the word “shall”; as such, it contains no requirements for industry. While the\nregulator in a safety case regulatory regime has the authority to analyze and challenge the requirements of\nAPI RP 939-C with the goal of driving continuous improvement and risk reduction (note the Buncefield\nexamples discussed in Section 4.3), in the present case Cal/OSHA utilized the voluntary practice as an\nopportunity to issue a citation to Chevron post-incident. Cal/OSHA did not analyze API RP 939-C to\ndetermine whether its provisions are sufficient to reduce risks and manage hazards. It also remains to be\nseen whether this citation will be upheld considering the permissive language contained within the\nstandard.\nChevron has investigated a number of sulfidation incidents at its refineries over the years, including\nRichmond, Salt Lake City, and Pascagoula. Figure 2 shows a timeline of Chevron’s key sulfidation\nevents. In January 2007, a failure due to sulfidation corrosion caused a serious fire in the Chevron\nRichmond Refinery crude unit resulting in a CWS Level 3 alert, injuring one worker and initiating a\nshelter-in-place for the surrounding community. As a result of these investigations, Chevron made\ninternal recommendations to require 100 percent component inspections in high-risk piping systems.\nHowever, these recommendations were not implemented in the Richmond Refinery crude unit prior to the\nincident, highlighting a lack of learning from previous incidents by Chevron.\n78\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\nFigure 2. Chevron's key sulfidation events between 1974 and 2013.\nIn addition, as a result of the January 2007 incident, Chevron informed Contra Costa Health Services’\nHazardous Materials Program399 (CCHMP) in a letter that the crude unit piping metallurgy had been\nupgraded following this incident as an inherently safer solution. However, the CSB learned that this\nupgrade was limited to only the immediate piping spool400 that failed. Cal/OSHA also did not require\nChevron to update the crude unit PHA to address the findings from this incident. Under a safety case\nregulatory regime, the regulator would work with the company to improve its practices following such an\nincident. The company would also be required to update its safety case report to address these corrosion\nhazards and demonstrate how the company has reduced risks to ALARP.\nThe CSB also noted in its Chevron Interim Report that despite internal recommendations to replace the\nentire #4 sidecut piping with an inherently safer, more corrosion-resistant material of construction,\nChevron’s 2006 Management of Change (MOC) analysis limited the application of those\nrecommendations. Instead of replacing the entire piping segment identified by the original\nrecommendation, the 2006 MOC considered only the replacement of a small section. Although the\nrecommendation was intended to more broadly apply inherently safer materials of construction, the final\nimplementation under the 2006 MOC limited the application of this more corrosion resistant\n399 Contra Costa Health Services’ Hazardous Materials program is designed to respond to emergencies and monitor\nhazardous materials within Contra Costa County. See http://cchealth.org/hazmat/ (accessed April 17, 2013).\nCCHSHMP also implements the CalARP and ISO programs, which will be discussed in greater detail later on.\n400 A piping spool is a small, removable section of piping. In some cases, a piping spool is installed or removed in\norder to provide a temporary connection or complete disconnection between two piping circuits.\n79\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\nmetallurgy.401 As the mere completion of an MOC and the implementation of any action item satisfy the\nCalifornia PSM standard requirements, regardless of its adequacy or effectiveness, Cal/OSHA did not\nevaluate the MOC or cite Chevron for narrowing the scope of the MOC, despite its disregard of internal\nrecommendations. Neither the California nor the federal PSM standards allow citations for inadequate\nMOCs. In addition, RAGAGEP does not apply to the MOC PSM element.\nThis can be contrasted with the safety case regulatory regime in the UK, where the HSE includes the\nadoption of inherently safer designs as an essential consideration for determining whether a duty holder\nhas reduced risks to ALARP.402 The HSE also notes that the guidance to COMAH Regulation 4, (the\nCOMAH General Duty provision) “describes the application of all measures necessary to reduce risk of a\nmajor accident to ALARP based on a hierarchical approach (inherent safety, prevention, control,\nmitigation).”403\n5.1.2.3 Process Safety Indicators\nAs the CSB has noted in its BP Texas City Investigation Report, Chevron Interim Report, and Section 4.5\nof this report, process safety indicators are a significant element of process safety management systems\nand are critical for reducing process safety incidents. A major goal of process safety indicators is to drive\ncontinuous process safety improvement. Regulators can utilize these indicators to focus inspections,\naudits, and investigations.\nFederally and in the state of California, neither the PSM standard nor the RMP rule require companies to\nutilize or report process safety indicators. Chevron voluntarily utilizes both leading and lagging\nindicators internally in its US petroleum refineries, in a system called Operational Excellence and\nReliability Intelligence (OERI), which tracks 26 different process safety indicators. OERI was\nimplemented in May 2009. However, Chevron is not required to report the status of its indicators to\nCalifornia regulators. Nor is Chevron held accountable to use the indicators to drive performance or\ncontinuous improvement. As a result, the CSB made a recommendation in its Chevron Interim Report to\nthe California State Legislature to identify and require the reporting of leading and lagging process safety\nindicators to state and local regulatory agencies, with the goal of improving mechanical integrity and\nprocess hazard analysis performance at all California petroleum refineries, and preventing major chemical\nincidents.\n5.1.2.4 Inspections\nAs noted in Section 4.6, safety case regulators utilize preventative inspections and audits to monitor\ncompliance with legislation and to ensure that the facility and its operations are consistent with\ninformation provided in the safety case. However, like federal OSHA, California regulations require\nCal/OSHA to prioritize accident, complaint, and referral-based inspections over planned inspections. As\nsuch, Cal/OSHA’s inspection program of the nearly 1,700 PSM-regulated facilities in California,\n401 As discussed in the Interim Report, only the section of piping downstream of the pumps was replaced with 9-\nChrome.\n402 HSE. The Safety Report Assessment Manual, Sections 8 to 15. p 30. http://www.hse.gov.uk/comah/sram/s8-\n15.pdf (accessed October 30, 2013).\n403 Ibid at 8.\n80\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\nincluding 14 petroleum refineries, 404 has been reactive in nature rather than proactive to maximize\nprevention.\nOSHA State Plan states405 were strongly encouraged but not required to implement the federal Petroleum\nRefinery NEP. Cal/OSHA did not adopt the NEP “because of its dedicated PSM Unit.”406 Between 2006\nand August 6, 2012, the Cal/OSHA PSM District Office conducted only three planned inspections of the\nChevron Richmond facility, totaling only 150 inspector hours of effort. Cal/OSHA has acknowledged\nthat these were not PQV inspections, as envisioned in its mission statement and in the federal PSM\ncompliance directive. None of these inspections resulted in citations or fines. According to statistics\nprovided by OSHA, federal NEP refinery inspections conducted between 2007 and the end of 2011\nrequired roughly 1,000 inspector hours each and resulted in an average of 11.2 violations and $76,821 in\npenalties per inspection. OSHA noted that hours spent on a typical federal refinery NEP inspection were\n40 times greater than the average OSHA inspection. These numbers indicate a major disparity in\nthoroughness and comprehensiveness between the planned inspections conducted by Cal/OSHA and the\nNEP inspections conducted by OSHA and other OSHA State Plan States. The federal NEP, which\nrepresented a more robust and intensive inspection program, ended in 2011 due to the stated great demand\non OSHA resources.\n5.1.2.5 Workforce Participation\nLike the federal PSM standard, California’s PSM standard provides for workforce participation in a\ncompany’s process safety management program. 8 CCR §5189 (p) requires an employer to develop a\nwritten plan to “ensure employee participation in process safety management” including “consultation\nwith employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of the elements of process\nsafety management…”407 However, developing a written plan to satisfy the regulatory requirements does\nnot ensure that workers and their representatives in practice are able to effectively participate in a\ncompany’s process safety management systems.\nIn its investigation of the Chevron incident, the CSB noted that the Chevron Richmond Refinery\nworkforce and its representatives, the United Steelworkers (USW), had expressed concerns regarding\nsulfidation corrosion and broader workplace safety issues, but were not consistently listened to by\nChevron managers, and their concerns regarding corrosion were not adequately acted upon. In November\n2011, Cal/OSHA investigated a complaint of unsafe working conditions during the fourth quarter\nRichmond Lube Oil Plant (RLOP) turnaround at the Richmond Refinery. The RLOP receives feedstock\nfrom the crude unit where the August 6th incident occurred and has similar sulfidation corrosion concerns.\nDuring the shutdown of the RLOP, a fire occurred at one of the RLOP furnaces. According to\nCal/OSHA’s inspection report, Chevron employees told Cal/OSHA that “OPERATORS GET\nIGNORED.” Many of the employees were concerned about increased corrosion they were finding during\nthe turnaround, and believed that increased temperatures and throughput rates had an adverse effect on\n404 Also see the California Labor Code Sections 6309 to 6315 (The California Occupational Safety and Health Act of\n1973).\n405 Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 encourages States to develop and operate their\nown job safety and health programs, referred to informally as an OSHA State Plan. OSHA approves and monitors\nState plans and provides up to 50 percent of an approved plan's operating costs.\n406 Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Occupational Safety and Health, California, Process Safety\nManagement District Office.

According to the interview notes, many operators had raised issues of corrosion in\nthe RLOP to higher level supervisors to no avail; according to one, if you raise an issue a couple of times,\n“you get labeled a ‘pest.’” The CSB has not identified evidence indicating that Cal/OSHA took further\naction to respond to these concerns, and Cal/OSHA did not issue any citations as a result of its\ninvestigation.408 Post-incident, significant sulfidation corrosion was found in the RLOP and piping and\nequipment were replaced.\nThe CSB found other significant evidence that increased workforce participation could have reduced the\nlikelihood that unchecked corrosion would lead to the August 2012 incident. As discussed in the CSB’s\nInterim Report on the Chevron incident, Chevron technical staff has considerable knowledge and\nexpertise regarding sulfidation corrosion, specifically with respect to corrosion rate variations caused by\ndiffering silicon concentration in carbon steel piping. Chevron employees have authored industry papers\non sulfidation corrosion and had significant influence in the development of the industry sulfidation\ncorrosion recommended practice, API RP 939-C. In 2009, Chevron Energy Technology Company\n(Chevron ETC)409 created an internal document on the subject of sulfidation corrosion. Chevron ETC\nmetallurgists released a formal report dated September 30, 2009 (nearly 3 years prior to the incident) to\nChevron refinery-based reliability managers and chief inspectors entitled Updated Inspection Strategies\nfor Preventing Sulfidation Corrosion Failures in Chevron Refineries.\nSulfidation experts explained in the Chevron ETC report that, “[u]ntil now, Chevron has not directly\naddressed the risk of low Si[licon] carbon steel…”410 and that the report introduced a program that “seeks\nto close these gaps, and to maximize the effectiveness of our inspection.” The report clearly indicates that\nChevron understood both the potential consequence and the high likelihood of a rupture or catastrophic\nfailure from sulfidation corrosion and calls out Chevron’s need for action.\nThe Chevron ETC report specifically recommended that inspectors perform 100 percent component\ninspection on high temperature carbon steel piping susceptible to sulfidation corrosion. However, this\n100 percent component inspection program was not implemented at the Richmond refinery prior to the\nAugust 6, 2012, incident. The Chevron ETC report defined a priority ranking system to help focus the\ninspection implementation efforts. The process conditions of the 4-sidecut pipe placed it in the highest\npriority for inspection.\nChevron ETC technical experts issued a corporate newsletter in 2010 that again warned of the potential\nconsequence of sulfidation failures. In this newsletter, the 100 percent component inspection\nrecommendation from the 2009 report was reiterated for piping systems such as the crude unit 4-sidecut\npiping. The newsletter stated:\nSulfidation corrosion failures … are of great concern because of the\ncomparatively high likelihood of ‘blowout’ or catastrophic failure. This\ntypically happens because corrosion occurs at a relatively uniform rate\nover a broad area, so a pipe can get progressively thinner until it actually\nbursts rather than leaking at a pit or local thin area. In addition, the\n408 Post-incident, there were significant mechanical integrity improvements and piping replaced in the RLOP unit.\n409 The Chevron Energy Technology Company is a separate business unit within the Chevron Corporation that\nprovides technology solutions and technical expertise for Chevron operations worldwide. See\nhttp://richmond.chevron.com/home/aboutchevronrichmond.aspx (accessed April 4, 2013).\n410 A 2003 corporate technical newsletter recommended 100 percent component inspection of carbon steel piping\nsusceptible to sulfidation corrosion following a 2002 Chevron Salt Lake City sulfidation corrosion incident.\n82\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\nprocess fluid is often above its auto ignition temperature. The\ncombination of these factors means that sulfidation corrosion failures\nfrequently result in large fires. Chevron and the industry have\nexperienced numerous failures from this mechanism and recent incidents\nhave reinforced the need for revised inspection strategies and a robust\nPMI (Positive Materials Identification) program.\nThe Chevron ETC 100 percent component inspection recommendation for high risk piping systems,\nestablished in 2009, was not implemented at Richmond, and the thin-walled low silicon 4-sidecut piping\ncomponent remained in service until it catastrophically failed on August 6, 2012.\nChevron and Chevron ETC metallurgists, materials engineers, and piping inspectors had expertise\nregarding sulfidation corrosion. They educated personnel and advocated for identification and control of\ndamage mechanisms, including sulfidation corrosion. However, they had limited practical influence to\nimplement their recommendations. These individuals did not participate in the crude unit PHA and did\nnot affect decisions concerning control of sulfidation corrosion during the crude unit turnaround\nprocess.411\nDespite the history of sulfidation corrosion incidents and the recommendations by Chevron’s workforce\nto implement better inspection methodologies, Cal/OSHA did not evaluate these recommendations or\ndetermine whether Chevron management ensured that the hazards of this damage mechanism were\naddressed and mitigated in Chevron’s PHAs. In addition, Cal/OSHA issued no citations to Chevron post-\nincident regarding the failure to address sulfidation corrosion in its crude unit PHA. Finally, when\nChevron employees raised concerns, Cal/OSHA did not effectively address them. The examples\nhighlighted in this section speak to the need for California to develop more effective regulation similar to\nthe UK legislation discussed in Section 4.4, to ensure strong workforce involvement in health and safety\nmatters at petroleum refineries. This will not only help prevent incidents such as the one that occurred at\nChevron, but it will also help improve communication and ensure that workers are represented in the\ndecisions that affect them.\n5.1.2.6 Funding and Regulator Competency\nCal/OSHA has not received sufficient funding to employ a well-staffed, multi-disciplinary team capable\nof conducting thorough inspections of PSM-covered facilities in California. This is apparent when\nexamining the lack of preventative, planned inspections of petroleum refineries being conducted by the\nPSM team in the state. In order for a safety regulatory regime to successfully regulate with the goal of\nmajor accident prevention, there must be a technically competent, well-resourced regulator in place to\nsufficiently review, scrutinize, and challenge the hazard identification and evaluation that has been\nconducted and controls that have been put in place to reduce risk, to help drive continuous improvement\nand ensure that risks are being controlled. It is not an acceptable outcome for society that petroleum\nrefineries with the potential for catastrophic accidents be inspected only after an accident occurs or a\ncomplaint is filed.\n411 The turnaround process includes both the planning stage prior to the shutdown and the activities staged during the\nshutdown.\n83\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\nCompensation is one important factor for recruiting and retaining technically competent personnel. The\nCSB found that California regulators are significantly less compensated when compared to their industry\ncounterparts. Based on information Chevron provided to the CSB, the average annual salary of refinery\npersonnel who would interact with a California regulator performing an audit or safety inspection is\n$187,630. Table 2 below provides the 2012 salaries of California regulatory personnel that the CSB\ndetermined would likely perform a safety inspection or a hypothetical safety case assessment. These\nfigures indicate a substantial compensation gap between the regulator and the regulated. A Cal/OSHA\nPSM team of associate safety engineers receive an average annual salary that is 46 percent lower than the\nrefinery employees they would likely interface with during an inspection. EPA RMP inspectors receive\nan annual salary that is 33 percent lower than their facility counterparts and Contra Costa County\naccidental release prevention engineers and their supervisor are paid 48 percent less than these industry\npersonnel.412\nEntity Average Annual Salary\nRefinery Personnel $187,630\nCal/OSHA $100,536\nContra Costa County $96,875\nEPA $125,000\nTable 2. Average 2012 salary for individuals selected by the CSB as representative of the\nprofessional staff within each California regulator and of the refinery professional staff who interface\nwith the regulators regarding audits or safety inspections at the Chevron Richmond Refinery.\nAs noted in the introduction of this report, the California State Legislature approved a 2013-2014 state\nbudget bill (AP 110) that allows the California Department of Industrial Relations to charge state\npetroleum refineries a fee by March 31, 2014, to support an increase in funding and to pay for at least 15\nnew positions in Cal/OSHA’s PSM Unit.413 The CSB considers this to be a positive step towards\nimproving process safety management in the state of California, as it will provide the team the\nopportunity to conduct more thorough inspections. However, it is imperative that these additional\ninspectors have the skills, knowledge, and experience to provide sufficient direct oversight over PSM-\ncovered facilities. Despite the additional funding, there remains a longstanding salary cap on associate\nsafety engineers within Cal/OSHA. This will continue to make it difficult for Cal/OSHA to consistently\nattract or retain the necessary talent and expertise to effectively oversee these facilities.\n412 Compensation information is based on salary only. It does not take into account non-salary information such as\nbonuses, retirement programs, or benefit programs.\n413 See http://www.caltax.org/homepage/062113_Legislature_Approves.html (accessed July 9, 2013).\n84\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\n5.2 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\nAccording to the EPA OIG, as of May 2012, only eight states and five local agencies had accepted full or\npartial RMP program delegation from EPA.414 As such, EPA regions directly implement the RMP\nprogram in most states. As no state agency has requested or received delegation to implement the RMP\nprogram within EPA Region 9, the federal EPA regional office is responsible for RMP program\nimplementation for California as well as Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii, the Pacific Islands, and 148 Tribal\nNations.\n5.2.1 Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program\nAs of March 2013, there were 1,137 RMP-covered facilities in Region 9: 957 in California; 118 in\nArizona; 42 in Nevada; 16 in Hawaii; and four in Guam.415 The Chevron Richmond Refinery has many\nprocesses covered by the RMP rule, including Program 3 processes, 416 such as the crude unit. As such,\nChevron is required to submit an RMP every five years to EPA Region 9, and EPA is expected to audit\nthe facility against this RMP to ensure compliance. According to Chevron’s most recent RMP submitted\nto EPA Region 9 in October 2011, its crude unit contained 400,000 pounds of a flammable mixture of\npropane, pentane, butane, ethane, and methane, well above the 10,000-pound threshold quantity for\nflammables.417\nEPA Region 9 employs four full-time and two part-time RMP inspectors to implement the RMP program\nfor the roughly 1,100 RMP-covered facilities in the entire region. Region 9 staff informed the EPA OIG\nthat to most effectively utilize their resources, they “place an additional focus on facilities in States, such\nas Arizona, that do not have their own risk management or accident prevention programs.418 The EPA’s\nmandates to conduct a certain number of inspections at high-risk facilities plus a lack of resources and\nstaffing prevent the inspectors from fully auditing many of the petroleum refineries in each state; thus, the\ninspectors aim to visit each refinery every three years, where they pick one process to evaluate for two to\nthree days. These inspectors target their inspections towards a specific industry issue during these visits.\nFor example, when they last inspected Chevron in 2010, the inspectors focused on the issue of high\ntemperature hydrogen attack (HTHA) due to the Tesoro incident that occurred in April 2010.419\n414 EPA OIG.

See EPA OIG. Evaluation Report: EPA Can Improve\nImplementation of the Risk Management Program for Airborne Chemical Releases; February 10, 2009; p 23.\n419 On April 2, 2010, a heat exchanger ruptured due to high temperature hydrogen attack, resulting in seven worker\nfatalities at the Tesoro Anacortes Refinery in Anacortes, Washington. The CSB is set to release its investigation\nreport on this incident near the end of January 2014.\n85\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\n5.2.2 Implementation of the RMP Program\nIn order for a safety regime to function well, there must be a competent, well-resourced regulator in place\nto implement the regime. However, the EPA Region 9 RMP group is extremely understaffed and under-\nresourced, as there are only six full-time inspectors to cover over 1,100 facilities across many states.\nInstead of fully inspecting or auditing petroleum refineries, the group is able to inspect one process at\neach refinery for two to three days every three years, which makes fully inspecting these facilities or\nauditing against the RMPs submitted by these facilities impossible. In addition, this group has other\nresponsibilities beyond the RMP program, including the management of contracts, emergency prevention\nand preparedness training and outreach, and reporting violations under the Comprehensive Environmental\nResponse, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). The CSB has learned that because this group\nhas such limited resources, it hopes to delegate RMP inspection authority to other agencies throughout the\nregion, as long as it maintains power to enforce violations.\nLike the federal and California PSM standards, the RMP regulations provide for workforce\nparticipation420 and require facilities to prepare a written plan of action regarding employee participation.\nIt is the RMP program’s policy to invite employee representatives to participate in all parts of onsite\ninspections. EPA Region 9 RMP staff told the CSB, however, that the limited amount of time they were\nable to spend onsite at refineries made speaking with facility inspectors and operators a difficult task.\nThey expressed that a lesson learned from the Chevron incident was that EPA RMP inspectors should\ncommit more time onsite during facility inspections and audits, which will allow them more time to speak\nwith workers to gain a better insight into how any issues within the facility are being addressed and\nresolved.421\nAs mentioned above, EPA guidance on the RMP program states that the owner or operator’s duty to\n“prevent accidents and ensure safety at [their] source…” may require steps to be taken “beyond those\nspecified in the risk management program rule.”422 While this principle appears to be similar to ALARP\nrequirements of the safety case, in practice this is not required, and whether this is done is not subject to\nregulation or review. Similar to the PSM standard, RMP regulations require each facility with Program 3\nprocesses to conduct a PHA as part of its prevention program that is “appropriate to the complexity of the\nprocess…and[] identify, evaluate, and control the hazards involved in the process.”423 However, these\nregulations do not require facilities to include these analyses in the RMPs they submit to EPA. Rather,\nfacilities with Program 2 or 3 processes are only required to include in the RMP very high-level,\nsimplified information on their prevention programs and their PHAs. The Chevron Richmond Refinery’s\nmost recent RMP submission from October 2011 included the following information on the PHAs for\neach relevant process: the date of the last PHA for that process; what technique was used; what major\nhazards were identified; what process controls were in use (i.e. automatic shutoffs, interlocks, alarms,\nemergency power); what mitigation systems were in use (i.e. dikes, fire walls, water curtain); what\nmonitoring/detection systems were in use (i.e. process area detectors); date of the most recent review or\n420 See 40 CFR §68.83 (2000).\n421 This need for greater interface with worker is a professional opinion by EPA staff, but has not resulted in EPA\npolicy modifications to ensure effective worker input in future inspections.\n422 EPA Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response.

Chevron included one paragraph entitled “E.5. General\nAccidental Release Prevention Program,” which stated that PSM is applied to the entire refinery, and the\nPSM program is documented in Refinery Instruction (RI)-360, “Richmond Refinery PSM Policy.” No\nadditional information or analysis could be located concerning the identification or control of hazards, or\nrisk reduction, as, unlike the safety case model, there is no requirement for the company to demonstrate to\nthe regulator that it is effectively ensuring that the safety systems are functioning as intended.\nUnder the EPA RMP program, there is no regulatory requirement to reduce risks to ALARP. In addition,\nthere is no requirement to submit to the regulator detailed information relating to risk reduction or hazard\nassessments. Finally, the Region 9 EPA RMP inspection team does not have the resources to fully audit\npetroleum refineries and other high hazard facilities subject to the RMP program. As a result, the EPA\nRMP program is not comprehensive or rigorous enough to control major accident hazards and reduce\nrisks. Instead, facilities submit high-level summary information providing evidence that the activity-\nbased requirements contained within the RMP regulations have been completed by the facility.\n5.3 Unified Program\nChevron’s Richmond refinery was also subject to process safety regulatory requirements at the county\nand city level. The facility had to adhere to additional requirements above the PSM and RMP regulations,\nbut these requirements were not sufficient to prevent the Chevron incident. The following sections will\ndiscuss those county and city requirements.\nIn 1993, Chapter 418, Statutes of 1993 (Senate Bill 1082) established Chapter 6.11 of the California\nHealth and Safety Code (HSC), which required the Secretary of the California Environmental Protection\nAgency (Cal/EPA) to adopt regulations creating a “unified hazardous waste and hazardous materials\nmanagement” regulatory program, or Unified Program, by January 1, 1996, to consolidate and make\nconsistent six existing hazardous materials and hazardous waste programs within the state.424 The\nSecretary of Cal/EPA was charged with ensuring that the Unified Program was established and\nimplemented by a Certified Unified Program Agency, or CUPA, in all counties in California. Cal/EPA\nadopted the Unified Program regulations under Title 27, Division 1 of the California Code of Regulations,\nwhich integrated six existing programs: the Hazardous Waste Generator and Onsite Hazardous Waste\nTreatment programs; the Aboveground Storage Tank program; the Underground Storage Tank program;\nthe Hazardous Materials Release Response Plans and Inventory program; the California Accidental\nRelease Prevention (CalARP) program; and the California Uniform Fire Code.425 The CalARP program,\nwhich was created through Assembly Bill AB1889 with the goal of major accident prevention, will be\ndiscussed at greater length below. There are currently 83 CUPAs in the state of California that implement\nthe Unified Program at a local level.426\n5.3.1.1 Contra Costa County Hazardous Materials Programs\nThe Chevron Richmond Refinery is located in the City of Richmond, within Contra Costa County. The\nlocal CUPA responsible for implementing the Unified Program in all areas of the country is the Contra\n424 California Health and Safety Code §25404(b) (1993). Also see\nhttp://www.calepa.ca.gov/cupa/Reports/2002/ReimbAcct.pdf (accessed May 16, 2013).\n425 27 CCR §15100 (a)(1) through (6) (1994).\n426 See http://www.calepa.ca.gov/cupa/Documents/2012/FactSheet.pdf (accessed May 16, 2013).\n87\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\nCosta Health Services’ Hazardous Materials Programs (CCHMP).427 CCHMP is responsible for\nimplementing the Unified Program in all areas of Contra Costa County.\nCCHMP implements two programs that are relevant to this investigation: the CalARP program and the\nCity of Richmond Industrial Safety Ordinance (RISO). CCHMP also implements the county’s own\nIndustrial Safety Ordinance (ISO), which covers seven facilities. CCHMP has five full-time engineers,\nknown as accidental release prevention engineers, who are responsible for implementing these programs\nfor the county. While all have technical degrees in engineering, only two of these engineers have past\nrefinery experience.\n5.3.1.1.1 CalARP\nThe California Health and Safety Code Article 2 (Chapter 6.95, Sections 25531 – 25543.3) was amended\neffective January 1, 1997, to implement EPA’s RMP program at the state level through the creation of the\nCalARP program regulations. Modeled after EPA’s RMP program and California’s Risk Management\nand Prevention Plan, which was enacted in 1986, the CalARP regulations (Title 19, Chapter 4.5 of the\nCCR) were implemented with the goal of preventing accidental releases of substances that can cause\nserious harm to the public and the environment, minimizing damage caused by a release, and to satisfy\ncommunity right-to-know laws.428 California is one of at least three states that implement a state RMP\nprogram without delegation of the federal program from EPA.429\nThe CalARP regulations, including PHA requirements, are essentially duplicative in nature to EPA’s\nRMP program, with a few exceptions: the list of toxic chemicals covered is 276 instead of 77; the\nthreshold quantities of some chemicals are smaller; CalARP requires a seismic analysis; and there is more\ninteraction with the public and other agencies.430 The CalARP regulations require that businesses that\nproduce, handle, process, distribute, or store certain chemicals over a certain threshold quantity develop a\nRisk Management Plan (RMP) and submit the RMP to a local CUPA for review. Like the EPA RMP\nprogram, facilities with a Program 3 process must develop a management system that includes a PHA and\nemergency response program.431 State oversight authority and responsibility for the CalARP program is\nwith the California Emergency Management Agency.432\nThe CalARP regulations apply to roughly 45 facilities in Contra Costa County, including the Chevron\nrefinery in Richmond. Each covered facility is required to submit an updated RMP to CCHMP at least\nonce every five years.433 The group of CCHMP engineers reviews these plans and is required to\n427 Contra Costa County’s Hazardous Materials program is responsible for responding to emergencies and\nmonitoring hazardous materials in Contra Costa County.

This group has told the CSB\nthat it audits each facility at least once every three years. It last audited Chevron in February 2011, and\nhas been conducting another audit in October and November 2013.\nAlthough CCHMP is authorized to issue enforcement actions for violations uncovered during facility\naudits, in practice CCHMP engineers issue “ensure” action items that list the deficiencies and recommend\nimprovements. They then work with the facility to make sure that these action items are implemented.\nCCHMP has rarely issued fines or citations to facilities for violations. If the engineers identify other gaps\nor areas for improvement that are not actual regulatory violations, they can issue “consider” action items,\nwhich are essentially suggestions to the facility for improvements that are not technically required to be\nimplemented by the regulation. Whether these types of action items are issued is dependent upon the\nknowledge and experience of the engineer conducting the audit. Once CCHMP engineers have\ncompleted the audit, CCHMP issues a final audit report on the facility, which they also supply to\nCal/OSHA’s PSM District Office and the EPA Region 9 RMP group.\n5.3.1.1.2 Industrial Safety Ordinance\nThe Contra Costa County Industrial Safety Ordinance (ISO) became effective January 15, 1999. Adopted\nas County Ordinance Chapter 450-8, the ISO expands on the CalARP program in Contra Costa County\nfor facilities meeting the following criteria: 1) the facility is within an unincorporated area of the County;\n2) the facility is either a petroleum refinery or chemical plant; 3) the facility is required to submit a Risk\nManagement Plan (RMP) to the EPA and the Contra Costa County Health Service; and 4) the facility has\nat least one Program 3 process.435 Seven of the 45 CalARP facilities in the county are currently required\nto comply with the ISO requirements.\nThe ISO was adopted to improve industrial safety by, among other things, requiring more comprehensive\ncoverage of the whole facility rather than only certain processes; providing review, inspection, auditing\nand safety requirements more stringent than are currently in effect; requiring the development and\nimplementation of a human factors program; and preventing and reducing the number, frequency and\nseverity of accidental releases in Contra Costa County.436\nFacilities subject to the ISO are essentially required to treat every process as subject to the CalARP\nProgram 3 prevention program requirements. Covered facilities have additional requirements as well,\nincluding developing and implementing a human factors program, considering inherently safer\ntechnologies and systems for new and existing facilities or processes, submitting a safety plan to\nCCHMP, and conducting a Management of Organizational Change (MOOC) prior to changes in\npermanent staffing levels or reorganization in operations, maintenance, health and safety, or emergency\nresponse.437\n434 22 CCR §2775.2(a) (2004).\n435 See http://cchealth.org/hazmat/pdf/iso/2006_iso_official_code_complete.pdf (accessed January 13, 2014).\n436 County Ordinance Chapter 450-8.004(a)(1) through (10) (2006).\nhttp://cchealth.org/hazmat/pdf/iso/2006_iso_official_code_complete.pdf (accessed January 13, 2014).\n437 Information available at http://cchealth.org/groups/hazmat/industrial_safety_ordinance_risk_management.php\n(accessed May 22, 2013).\n89\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\n5.3.1.1.3 City of Richmond Industrial Safety Ordinance\nOn December 18, 2001, the City of Richmond adopted an Industrial Safety Ordinance (RISO) under\nMunicipal Code Chapter 6.43 that was almost identical to the ISO. In February 2013, the City of\nRichmond Council amended the RISO to make it equivalent to the ISO. Chevron is one of two facilities\nsubject to RISO requirements. Pursuant to an agreement with the City of Richmond, CCHMP\nimplements and enforces the RISO within the city.\nLike the ISO, the RISO requires that a covered facility submit a safety plan to CCHMP that includes\nsafety elements such as process safety information (PSI), operating procedures, mechanical integrity,\nemployee participation, and management of change (MOC).438 CCHMP has posted a Safety Plan\nGuidance Document on its website to assist facilities in developing these plans. Each facility is also\nrequired to comply with safety requirements including performing PHAs, and must include a description\nof the manner of compliance with these in the safety plan.439 In performing a PHA, facilities are required\nto address the hazards of the process, identify any previous incident, identify controls applicable to the\nhazards, and identify consequences of failure of those controls, human factors, and a qualitative\nevaluation of a range of possible safety and health effects of failure of controls.440\nThe CCHMP engineers are required to review each facility’s safety plan as well as audit each facility to\ndetermine compliance with ISO or RISO. CCHMP engineers conduct the CalARP and ISO/RISO audits\nconcurrently at each covered facility. CCHMP generally audits each facility once every three years. To\naid in the auditing process, CCHMP engineers have entered all the CalARP program requirements into a\ndatabase. They have taken each of these requirements and turned them into questions. When the\nengineers go onsite, they perform three main functions: 1) they identify and review any policy statement\nthat directs how people should handle a particular piece of equipment; 2) they identify and review records\nof procedures, such as MOCs and permits; and 3) they randomly select and interview individuals about\ntheir familiarity with various aspects of different programs. If the engineers find a regulatory deficiency,\nthey issue an ensure action item to the facility.\nOnce the engineers have completed their facility audit, they issue a preliminary determination to the\nfacility. The facility has 90 days to review the draft and provide a proposed remedy with specifics on\nhow they will fix each deficiency, and the timeline. Once the report is finalized it goes out for public\ncomment. Following public comment, it is issued to the facility and provided to Cal/OSHA’s PSM\nDistrict Office and the EPA Region 9 RMP group.\n5.3.1.2 Analysis\nChevron submitted its most updated safety plan to CCHMP on February 25, 2013. Section 3.12 of the\nplan discusses PHAs and Action Items. Under this section, Chevron lists eight objectives of its PHAs,\nincluding identifying possible failures or releases, evaluating potential consequences, and proposing\nrecommendations that would reduce the risks. Chevron also discusses its possible justifications for\ndeclining recommendations from PHAs, including the fact that an alternative measure would be\nsufficient, and that the recommendation may be infeasible. There was no additional information or\n438 Richmond Municipal Code Section 6.43.090 (a) (2013).\n439 Ibid at Sections (a) through (e) (2013).\n440 Ibid at (d) (2013).\n90\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\nanalysis contained in this section concerning the identification or control of hazards, or risk reduction, as\nthere is no requirement to do so.\nThe RISO and CalARP regulations require that PHAs list controls and possible consequences of failure of\nthose controls, but there is no specific requirement to include evaluations of the safeguards and controls in\nthe PHA. As CCHMP engineers are only required to audit against the regulatory requirements, they\nwould only examine the evaluation of safeguards if such an evaluation were performed and documented\nin the facility’s PHAs. As noted previously, Chevron’s most recent crude unit PHA ineffectively listed\nqualitative safeguards for corrosion and mechanical integrity.\nWhile CCHMP engineers are able to issue “consider” action items to the facility recommending actions\nabove and beyond regulatory requirements, CCHMP engineers did not do this regarding Chevron’s Crude\nUnit PHA or its evaluation of safeguards. After reviewing CCHMP’s most recent audit of Chevron, the\nCSB could find nothing referring to sulfidation corrosion, reduction of risk, or safeguard evaluation.\nWhile CCHMP is able to utilize these “consider” action items to encourage facilities to go above and\nbeyond regulatory requirements to reduce risk, CCHMP engineers have stated to the CSB that they do not\nmake sufficient use of this mechanism. Rather, they tend to audit against the existing regulatory\nrequirements to ensure compliance.\nUnlike the safety case regulatory approach, which requires a reduction of risk to ALARP or equivalent,\nfacilities covered by RISO or ISO are only required to “consider [emphasis added] the use of inherently\nsafer systems in the development and analysis of mitigation items resulting from a process hazard\nanalysis [PHA] and in the design and review of new processes and facilities.”441 Despite multiple internal\nrecommendations to replace its piping due to the risk of sulfidation corrosion, Chevron failed to replace\nthe piping prior to the incident with an inherently safer material. Again, the CSB has not found evidence\nthat CCHMP effectively encouraged Chevron to go above and beyond regulatory requirements by\nutilizing inherently safer systems to reduce risk.\nAs emphasized repeatedly in this report, a regulatory regime is only as strong as its regulators, and must\nemploy individuals with the requisite skills, knowledge, and experience to provide sufficient oversight\nover facilities. In the case of CCHMP, there are only five engineers for nearly 45 facilities in the county,\nand only two have previous refinery experience.442 In addition, while the CCHMP is funded mostly\nthrough CUPA fees, ISO fees, and other means of cost recovery, the engineers are part of a bargaining\nunit and their salaries are paid through the county’s general fund, which has experienced annual budget\nreductions in the millions.443 This has unnecessarily resulted in a decrease in the CCHMP engineers’\nsalaries and has made it extremely difficult for CCHMP to fill a current position that has been open over\nthree years because of its inability to offer competitive salaries to attract its engineers. Overall, CCHMP\nsuffers from a lack of resources and funding, limiting its ability to hire additional highly qualified staff to\noversee the petroleum refineries in Contra Costa County.\n441 City of Richmond Municipal Code §6.43.050(g) (February 5, 2013).\n442 Two of the other engineers have chemical plant experience and have led or participated in refinery compliance\naudits in the past ten years.\n443 More information available at http://www.co.contra-costa.ca.us/DocumentCenter/Home/View/8917 (accessed\nMay 23, 2013).\n91\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\n6.0 Conclusion\nThis report has focused on several attributes of more robust process safety management regulatory\nregimes from around the world that the CSB believes would greatly enhance existing federal and\nCalifornia process safety regulations. Some attributes discussed include: an enhanced process hazard\nanalysis; continuous risk reduction to ALARP; active workforce participation; the effective use of process\nsafety indicators that drive performance; regulatory assessment, verification, and intervention; and an\nindependent, competent, well-funded regulator. These attributes together enable industry and the\nregulator to ensure that facilities are developing and implementing comprehensive, robust safety\nmanagement systems to prevent major accidents.\nImplementation of a more comprehensive process safety management regulatory approach in California\nfor petroleum refineries will require a commitment of extensive resources to fund a regulator that has the\nrequisite skills, knowledge, and experience to ensure petroleum refineries in the state continually assess\ntheir practices and reduce risks to ALARP. However, the CSB believes that effective implementation of\nthis regulatory approach will achieve greater major accident prevention in California and, in the process,\nprovide greater protection for its workers and the public.\nAn enhanced process safety management regulatory model provides the adaptability necessary to keep\ncurrent with improving standards and advancing technology, without requiring lengthy and often\nunproductive rulemaking on the part of the regulator. A competent regulator will independently ensure\nthat California refineries have taken all practical measures that can be reasonably taken to reduce risks.\nFor example, the regulator would have the ability to work with these facilities to implement\nrecommendations and lessons learned from significant petroleum refinery incidents throughout the world\nwithout requiring extensive rulemaking or legislation, as regulators have done post-incident in the UK,\nNorway, and Australia. (Additional information and discussion of the safety case type regime is included\nin Appendix C).\n92\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\n7.0 Process Safety Management Reform at the Federal Level: A\nPath Forward\nAs this report discusses, process safety management in the US has undergone little reform since its\ninception in the 1990s despite advancing best practices and technology. On July 25, 2013, the CSB held a\npublic meeting to discuss the status of three key CSB safety recommendations made to OSHA in the last\ndecade to revise and improve the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.444 While acknowledging\nsome positive steps taken by OSHA, such as including process safety management in its regulatory\nagenda, the CSB expressed at the meeting its disappointment with OSHA’s lack of progress with\nimplementation of open CSB recommendations to improve the PSM standard.445 As a result of the\nmeeting, the Board voted to change the status of the three recommendations made to OSHA concerning\nthe PSM standard to “Open-Unacceptable”.446\nRecent significant incidents such as the April 2013 explosion and fire that occurred at a fertilizer storage\nand distribution facility in West, Texas, and resulted in fifteen fatalities and hundreds of injuries, have\nresulted in an increased national dialogue on the issue of process safety management reform.447 As\nmentioned in Section 2.0 above, President Obama has issued a number of Executive Orders focused on\nimproving chemical safety in the US. On January 18, 2011, President Obama issued Executive Order\n13563,448 which called for improvements in the nation’s regulatory system to promote predictability and\nreduce uncertainty and to use the best, most innovative, and least burdensome tools for achieving\nregulatory ends.\n444 The CSB made a fourth recommendation (2001-01-H-R1) to OSHA in its 2002 reactive hazards study to modify\nthe PSM standard to more comprehensively manage reactive hazards. On January 28, 2004, the Board voted\nunanimously to designate the status of this recommendation as “Open-Unacceptable”.\n445 For a copy of the public meeting transcript see http://www.csb.gov/assets/1/7/0725CSB-OSHA_(2).pdf (accessed\nOctober 27, 2014).\n446 “Open-Unacceptable” means that the recommendation recipient responds by expressing disagreement with the\nneed outlined in the recommendation. The Board believes, however, that there is enough supporting evidence to ask\nthe recipient to reconsider. The three open recommendations concerning the PSM standard are: 1)\nRecommendation to ensure coverage under the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard for atmospheric storage\ntanks that could be involved in a potential catastrophic release as a result of being interconnected to a covered\nprocess with 10,000 pounds of a flammable substance. The recommendation was issued in 2002 following the\nCSB’s investigation of a 2001 explosion of a poorly maintained, corroded storage tank containing spent sulfuric\nacid and flammable hydrocarbons at the Motiva refinery in Delaware City, Delaware. A worker was conducting\nhot work which ignited vapor through holes in the deteriorated tank. 2) Recommendation to revise the PSM\nstandard to require management of change (MOC) reviews for organizational changes such as mergers and\nacquisitions that may impact process safety. This recommendation, issued in 2007, followed the 2005 explosions\nand fire at the BP Texas City refinery which killed 15 workers and injured 180 others. 3) Recommendation that\nOSHA issue a fuel gas safety standard for construction and general industry. This recommendation, issued in June\n2010 followed two catastrophic accidents that occurred that year: In one, an explosion caused a roof collapse at the\nConAgra Slim Jim facility in Garner, North Carolina, killing four workers and injuring 67 others. A worker had\nbeen attempting to purge new natural gas piping during the installation of an industrial water heater, resulting in a\nlarge release of natural gas indoors. In the other, at the Kleen Energy power plant in Middletown, Connecticut, high\npressure natural gas was being used to clean new piping and was released in a congested outdoor area.

Reg. 14 (January 21, 2011).\nhttp://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/2011.html (accessed July 10, 2013).\n93\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\nFollowing the incident in West, Texas, President Obama issued Executive Order 13650, Improving\nChemical Facility Safety and Security , on August 1, 2013.449 The Executive Order established the\nChemical Facility Safety and Security Working Group, a working group of federal agencies450 tasked\nwith, among other things, developing options for enhancing and modernizing policies, regulations, and\nstandards to improve the safety and security of chemical facilities.451, 452\nConsistent with Executive Order 13650, both OSHA and the EPA issued Requests for Information, or\nRFIs, in the last year, requesting comment on potential revisions to several standards, including the\nProcess Safety Management (Standard) and the Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program regulations,\nrespectively.453 These are all positive steps toward significant improvements in process safety\nmanagement at the federal level. CSB Chairperson Rafael Moure-Eraso has publicly advocated for\nExecutive Order 13650 implementation, including requirements for safer technologies, regulation of\nreactive chemicals like the ammonium nitrate stored at West's fertilizer site, public reporting of process\nsafety indicators, and regulatory coverage for hazardous oil drilling and production operations.454\nThe CSB believes that it is important to continue to build upon this significant national dialogue. In the\ncoming months, the CSB will consider adding the issue of federal process safety management reform and\nmodernization to its Most Wanted Chemical Safety Improvements Program (“Most Wanted Program”).455\nThe purpose of the Most Wanted Program is to:\n• identify the most important chemical safety improvement goals of the CSB in the form of a “Most\nWanted List” of Chemical Safety Improvements, which will be based on recommendations\nresulting from CSB investigations, studies, hearings, and similar fact-finding activities;\n449 Improving Chemical Facility Safety and Security.

The public hearing will include\ndiscussion of various models for high hazard facility safety regulation from around the US and the world\n– including consideration of safety case type models. Presentations, or written comments, regarding\nvarious regimes should discuss, at a minimum, the following:\n• The role of transparency and community involvement;\n• The effectiveness of worker (union and non-union) involvement programs and the effectiveness\nof protecting workers from retaliatory actions;\n• The methods for measuring process safety performance and for reporting of process safety\nindicator data (to regulators, the public, third parties, or industry groups);\n• The approach used to strive for risk reduction and continuous improvement;\n• The approach for establishing a “tolerable” risk level; and\n• The effectiveness of enforcement methods.\nThe CSB will hold this public hearing in the Spring of 2015, following the publication of this\nreport. Upon completion of the public hearing the CSB will publish a document summarizing\nthe proceedings.\n95\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\n8.0 Recommendations\nPursuant to its authority under 42 U.S.C. §7412(r)(6)(C)(i) and (ii), and in the interest of promoting safer\noperations at California petroleum refineries and protecting workers and communities from future\naccidents, the CSB makes the following safety recommendations:\nCalifornia State Legislature,\nGovernor of California\n2012-03-I-CA-R21\nBased on the findings in this report, enhance and restructure California’s process safety management\n(PSM) regulations for petroleum refineries by including the following goal-setting attributes:\na. Require a comprehensive process hazard analysis (PHA) written by the company that includes:\ni. Systematic analysis and documentation of all major hazards and safeguards, using the\nhierarchy of controls to identify hazards and significantly reduce risks to a goal of as low as\nreasonably practicable (ALARP) or similar;\nii. Documentation of the recognized methodologies, rationale and conclusions used to claim that\ninherently safer systems have been implemented to as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP) or\nsimilar, and that additional safeguards intended to control remaining hazards will be effective;\niii. Documented damage mechanism hazard review conducted by a diverse team of qualified\npersonnel. This review shall be an integral part of the process hazard analysis (PHA) cycle and\nshall be conducted on all covered processes, piping circuits and equipment. The damage\nmechanism hazard review shall identify potential process damage mechanisms and consequences\nof failure, and shall ensure effective safeguards are in place to prevent or control hazards\npresented by those damage mechanisms. Require the analysis and incorporation of applicable\nindustry best practices and inherently safer design to the greatest extent feasible into this review;\nand\niv. Documented use of inherently safer systems analysis and the hierarchy of controls to the\ngreatest extent feasible in establishing safeguards for identified process hazards. The goal shall\nbe to drive the risk of major accidents to As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) or similar.\nInclude requirements for inherently safer systems analysis to be automatically triggered for all\nmanagement of change (MOC) and process hazard analysis (PHA) reviews, as well as prior to the\nconstruction of new processes, process unit rebuilds, significant process repairs, and in the\ndevelopment of corrective actions from incident investigation recommendations.\n96\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\nb. Require a thorough review of the comprehensive process hazard analysis by technically competent\nregulatory personnel;\nc. Require preventative audits and preventative inspections by the regulator to ensure the effective\nimplementation of the comprehensive process hazard analysis (PHA);\nd. Require that all safety codes, standards, employer internal procedures and recognized and generally\naccepted good engineering practices (RAGAGEP) used in the implementation of the regulations contain\nadequate minimum requirements;\ne. Require mechanisms for the regulator, the refinery, and workers and their representatives to play an\nequal and essential role in the direction of preventing major incidents. Require an expanded role for\nworkers in management of process safety by establishing the rights and responsibilities of workers and\ntheir representatives on health and safety-related matters, and the election of safety representatives and\nestablishment of safety committees (with equal representation between management and labor) to serve\nhealth and safety-related functions. The elected representatives should have a legally recognized role that\ngoes beyond consultation in activities such as the development of the comprehensive process hazard\nanalysis, implementation of corrective actions generated from hierarchy of control analyses, management\nof change, incident investigation, audits, and the identification, prevention, and control of all process\nhazards. The regulation should provide workers and their representatives with the authority to stop work\nthat is perceived to be unsafe until the employer resolves the matter or the regulator intervenes.\nWorkforce participation practices should be documented by the refinery to the regulator;\nf. Require reporting of information to the public to the greatest extent feasible, such as a summary of the\ncomprehensive process hazard analysis (PHA) which should include a list of inherently safer systems\nimplemented; safeguards implemented for remaining hazards; standards utilized to reduce risks to As\nLow As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) or similar; and process safety indicators that demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the safeguards and management systems;\ng. Implement an approach or system that determines when new or improved industry standards and\npractices are needed and initiate programs and other activities, such as an advisory committee or forum, to\nprompt the timely development and implementation of such standards and practices; and\nh. Ensure that a means of sustained funding is established to support an independent, well-funded, well-\nstaffed, technically competent regulator.\n2012-03-I-CA-R22\nImplement a compensation system to ensure the regulator has the ability to attract and retain a sufficient\nnumber of employees with the necessary skills and experience to ensure regulator technical competency\nat all levels of process safety regulatory oversight and policy development in California. A market\nanalysis and benchmarking review should be periodically conducted to ensure the compensation system\nremains competitive with California petroleum refineries.\n97\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\n2012-03-I-CA-R23\nWork with the regulator, the petroleum refining industry, labor, and other relevant stakeholders in the\nstate of California to develop and implement a system that collects, tracks, and analyzes process safety\nleading and lagging indicators from refineries and contractors to promote continuous safety\nimprovements. At a minimum, this program shall:\na. Require the use of leading and lagging process safety indicators to actively monitor the\neffectiveness of process safety management systems and safeguards for major accident\nprevention. Include leading and lagging indicators that are measureable, actionable, and\nstandardized. Require that the reported data be used for continuous process safety improvement\nand accident prevention;\nb. Analyze data to identify trends and poor performers and publish annual reports with the data at\nfacility and corporate levels;\nc. Require companies to publicly report required indicators annually at facility and corporate\nlevels;\nd. Use process safety indicators (1) to drive continuous improvement for major accident\nprevention by using the data to identify industry and facility safety trends and deficiencies and (2)\nto determine appropriate allocation of regulator resources and inspections; and\ne. Be periodically updated to incorporate new learning from world-wide industry improvements\nin order to drive continuous major accident safety improvements in California.\nMayor and City Council,\nCity of Richmond, California\n2012-03-I-CA-R24\nImplement or cause to be implemented a compensation system to ensure the regulator has the ability to\nattract and retain a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills and experience to ensure\nregulator technical competency at all levels of process safety regulatory oversight and policy development\nin Richmond, California.

Is it true that the safety case regulatory approach leads to self-regulation by industry?\nCritics of the safety case regulatory approach have noted that this type of regulatory regime is likely to\nresult in mere industry self-regulation.456 Critics have also noted that this is at least partly due to the fact\nthat there is no will in the US to ensure that regulators have the tools, resources, and competence to\neffectively regulate workplaces. The CSB and those with experience in developing and implementing the\nsafety case regulatory regime have repeatedly stated that the purpose of the safety case regulatory\napproach is to ensure that all hazards have been identified, evaluated, and controlled so that risks are\nreduced to as low as reasonably practicable, or ALARP. In simple terms, the safety case report is a series\nof claims as to how an installation is being safety operated. The real strength of the safety case regulatory\nregime is testing the validity of those claims through strategic intervention by competent, well-funded\nregulators. Advanced performance-based regulatory regimes in the United Kingdom (UK) and Norway,\nfor example,457 incorporate a list of regulator-accepted standards and good practices that provide\ncompanies with the minimum performance that is expected. Companies must demonstrate that they meet\nor exceed those standards. Therefore, companies are aware of minimum performance expectations they\nmust meet as they work to reduce risks to ALARP. If a competent regulator is not in place, then the\nsafety case report equates to nothing more than a lifeless document sitting on a shelf, and the criticism of\nself-regulation becomes valid.\nIt is also important to point out that in a letter from the USW Local 5 to the CSB dated November 22,\n2013, it was stated that “[t]he current system is truly a self regulated system, with the industry setting the\nrules, changing the rules, and monitoring themselves.” Individuals are noting that the current system in\nplace has actually led to self-regulation despite the intent of the PSM standard and RMP program to be\nperformance-based.\nCritics have also argued that there is a lack of transparency with the safety case regime. However, under\nthe existing PSM standard, none of the PSM elements are made public by the company or the regulator,\nincluding the process hazard analyses and management of change documents. To improve transparency,\nmany safety case regimes collect and report indicator data, and companies are required make safety case\nreport summaries publicly available. These are high level documents that are published online and\nsummarize safety assessments, hazardous materials, hazards and control measures, potential major\nincidents, emergency response, and safety management systems.\nRather than accepting the inevitability of catastrophic events, we should act to prevent them from\nhappening. As discussed in this report, there is a movement in California to improve oversight of\n456 See e.g. Rena Steinzor. Lessons from the North Sea: Should “Safety Cases” Come to America?

The UK implements a safety case regime both onshore and\noffshore.\n111\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\npetroleum refineries. There has also been increased dialogue in the US in recent years surrounding the\nregulation of the oil and gas industry and how to make improvements. As such, the support exists to not\nonly shift the current activity-based regulatory structure to a more goal-based safety case regulatory\nregime, but to also ensure that competent, well-funded regulators are in place to implement and enforce\nsuch a regime.\n2. How does the safety case regulatory regime in the US allow for changes to be made without requiring\nrulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act?\nThe Administrative Procedure Act, or APA, was passed in 1947, and lays out the basic framework under\nwhich federal rulemaking is conducted. It defines “rule” as “the whole or a part of an agency statement of\ngeneral or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or\npolicy or describing the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of an agency…”458\n“Rulemaking” is defined as the “agency process for formulating, amending, or repealing a rule.”459\nFederal agencies often impact their specific area of jurisdiction by publishing rules promulgated through\nnotice and comment rulemaking, or informal rulemaking, under the APA. Unfortunately, as this report\ndiscusses at length, the rulemaking process in the US is cumbersome and some federal agencies, such as\nOSHA and the EPA, are subject to additional requirements and more stringent review standards that go\nabove and beyond those contained in the APA. To avoid these additional burdens, many agencies provide\nfurther guidance to regulated parties through more informal means, such as answering questions and\nissuing policy statements, guidance, or opinion letters. Another way to lessen the burden on regulating\nagencies and their regulated entities is to adopt performance or goal-based regulations rather than\nprescriptive regulations. Performance-based standards state the objective or outcome to be achieved, such\nas risk reduction, without describing the specific means of obtaining that objective. This provides the\nregulated entities with the freedom and flexibility to work to achieve a stated goal, such as reducing risks\nto as low as reasonably practicable, or ALARP, through their chosen and preferred means.460\nPerformance-based standards also provide flexibility to the regulator; for example, in a safety case\nregulatory regime, should the regulator determine through assessment of the safety case report and/or\ninspection that the facility has not reduced risks to ALARP with regard to a specific hazard, he or she may\nrequire that the facility take additional steps to further reduce risk without needing to propose and adopt a\nnew rule or regulation to address it. The regulator must accept the safety case report in order for the\nfacility to operate.\nThe Regulatory Flexibility Act was passed in 1980 during the Carter Administration. It requires agencies\nto prepare and make available for public comment regulatory flexibility analyses of proposed rulemaking,\nand also encourages agencies to consider alternatives to rulemaking, including “the use of performance\nrather than design standards…”461 Executive Order 13272 then directed federal agencies to establish\nprocedures and policies to comply with the Act.462 Federal agencies have been encouraged to adopt\n458 5 U.S.C. §551(4) (2011).\n459 5 U.S.C. §551(5) (2011).\n460 Such as reliance upon qualitative assessments, quantitative assessments, semi-quantitative risk assessments, and\ngood practice guidance.\n461 5 U.S.C. §603(3) (2010).\n462 Exec.

Recognizing the inefficient process of federal\nrulemaking in the US, President Clinton signed Executive Order 12866 in September of 1993, which,\namong other things, directed federal agencies to “identify and assess alternative forms of\nregulation…[and] specify performance objectives, rather than specifying the behavior or manner of\ncompliance that regulated entities must adopt.”463 Executive Order 13563, entitled Improving Regulation\nand Regulatory Review, supplemented and reaffirmed Executive Order 12866 by ordering agencies to\n“identify and consider regulatory approaches that reduce burdens and maintain flexibility and freedom of\nchoice for the public.”464 Its stated goal was to “protect public health, welfare, safety, and our\nenvironment while promoting economic growth, innovation, competitiveness, and job creation.”465 Its\nseven guiding principles are as follows:\n• Increase predictability and reduce uncertainty;\n• Use and rely on best available science;\n• Ensure public participation and open exchange of ideas;\n• Use the most innovative and least burdensome tools;\n• Consider cost benefit analysis (quantitative and qualitative);\n• Ensure regulations are publicly available, consistent, written in plain language and easy to\nunderstand; and\n• Measure results and seek to improve actual results.466\nThe safety case regime aims to satisfy all of these principles.\nCalifornia has adopted its own version of the APA, known as the California Administrative Procedure\nAct (CAPA) (California Government Code §11340 et seq.).467 Among its many requirements for\nCalifornia state agencies that adopt regulations, CAPA directs them to consider the substitution of\nperformance standards for prescriptive standards.468 CAPA defines “performance standard” as “a\nregulation that describes an objective with the criteria stated for achieving the objective.”469\nFederal agencies that are engaged in and responsible for regulating high hazards, such as NASA and the\nNuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), have adopted goal or performance-based standards that require\nrisks to be reduced to “as safe as reasonably practicable” (ASARP) and “as low as reasonably\nachievable,” (ALARA), respectively. The OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard also\ncontains performance-based elements to some extent; for example, it provides regulated entities with\nflexibility in how to perform a process hazard analysis (PHA). However, it contains no risk reduction\ngoals such as ALARP. This has resulted in an activity-based regulatory scheme that emphasizes\ncompleting activities, such as a PHA or a Management of Change (MOC) analysis, rather than actual risk\nreduction. Without a risk reduction goal such as ALARP in place, the PSM standard will not have the\n463 Exec. Order No. 12866, 48 Fed.

Can the safety case regulatory approach work in the US when workforce involvement is emphasized\nless than other regions and unionization rates are lower than other countries?\nA majority of the workforce in California petroleum refineries is unionized, as the unionization rate for\nthe 14 petroleum refineries in California is actually 73 percent,470 which is significantly higher than the\n2012 rates for the US as a whole (11.1 percent), Australia (17.9 percent), the UK (25.8 percent), and\nNorway (54.7 percent).471 Despite a declining unionization rate in the UK, the region has developed\nstrong onshore and offshore regulations that provide for the creation of protected safety representative\npositions and safety committees for unionized and non-unionized facilities. These positions are meant to\ncreate a healthier and safer workplace, and result in better decision-making regarding health and safety,\nincreased productivity, higher workforce motivation, a stronger commitment to implementing decisions\nor actions (as employees have been actively involved in reaching these decisions), and greater\ncooperation and trust.472 The HSE has devoted extensive time and resources to ensuring employers are\ncomplying with these regulations and understand the importance and benefits of involving workers in\nhealth and safety-related matters.\nThe UK also has a standard establishing the minimum level of training that elected safety representatives\noffshore should receive to enable them to fully perform their functions as defined in the Safety\nRepresentatives and Safety Committees Regulations – SI 1989/971. This training standard, entitled the\nOPITO Approved Standard, was developed by an industry workgroup facilitated by OPITO.473 In June\n2013, Det Norske Veritas (DNV)474 became accredited by OPITO to offer newly developed training\ncourses to more than 2,000 elected safety representatives in the offshore industry. The training, which\nhas been driven and supported by HSE, Oil and Gas UK, and the Offshore Industry Advisory\nCommittee’s Workforce Involvement Group, consists of four separate Modules run over the course of\neight days.475 The training covers topics such as Understanding and Identifying Major Accident Hazards\nand Investigating Incidents and Applying Root Cause Analysis.\nThe CSB recognizes the HSE’s effort to improve workforce involvement through regulations, protected\npositions, and training, and has recommended in this report that California develop regulations and\nguidelines to establish similar protected safety positions to ensure effective workforce participation. The\n470 In September 2013, the USW provided the CSB with a list of California petroleum refinery locations as of\nOctober 2012 and the existing unionization representation at those refineries.

Has the safety case regulatory approach resulted in fewer major accidents?\nThe CSB has identified a small number of independent studies conducted on the impact of the safety case\nregulatory approach on safety performance onshore and offshore. In 1999, a report commissioned by the\nHSE (“the Aberdeen Report”) which evaluated the impact of the offshore Safety Case Regulations on\noffshore safety was published.476 One of the purposes of the study was to review published safety data\nfor trends in offshore accidents and incidents from 1990 until 1997.477 Upon this review, it was\ndetermined there had been a decrease in accidents since the implementation of the offshore safety case\nregulations in the UK, but cautioned it was difficult to distinguish the effect of the safety case regulations\nfrom other industry activities such as the level and type of exploration and production activity, oil prices,\nand industry-led initiatives.478 The Aberdeen Report also cautioned about the difficulties in analyzing\noffshore data that also hold true for the more current data presented in Figure 3. The total number of\naccidents and incidents recorded can be affected by industry attitudes toward reporting, changes in how\nand what data is reported, and the decrease or increase in offshore activity. As stated in the Aberdeen\nReport, “[d]espite these cautions, accident statistics play an important role in the analysis of the state of\nsafety in any industry, since accidents represent the ‘bottom line’ in safety. It is therefore important to\nanalyze the trends, but to also take the drawbacks into consideration.”479 As discussed in this report, the\nreporting and analyzing leading process safety indicators is important to gain a better understanding of\nhow safety management systems are functioning, and thus a better idea of how well the various regimes\nare managing hazards and mitigating risk.\nStatistics from the seven years covered by the Aberdeen Report indicated an overall decrease in reported\naccident rates in the UK and Norwegian databases up until 1994. From 1994 to 1997, both the UK and\nNorway reported a slight increase in the number of reported accidents.480 Norway did report a drop in\n1997 from 1996. The decrease reported up until 1994 for the UK appeared to be independent of the\noffshore production activities as those levels had been on the increase during the same time period.\nDrilling in the UK decreased during the same time frame, making the cause for the decrease in reported\ndrilling accidents unclear.\nMore recent reviews of accident data indicate decreasing trends in accident statistics. The Presidential Oil\nSpill Commission noted the following in its report to the President on the Macondo disaster:\n[f]rom 2004 to 2009, fatalities in the offshore oil and gas industry were\nmore than four times higher per person-hours worked in U.S. waters than\nin European waters, even though many of the same companies work in\nboth venues. This striking statistical discrepancy reinforces the view that\nthe problem is not an inherent trait of the business itself, but rather\n476 Evaluation of the Offshore Safety Legislative Regime—A study undertaken by AUPEC Ltd.

The HRC data, plotted in\nFigure 3, show the total number of releases to be on the decline. Classifying the severity of a release is\nbased on agreed-upon criteria with the offshore industry.486 The UK has defined significant events to be\nthose that, if ignited, have the potential to cause a major accident where multiple casualties could occur.\nThe occurrence of any hydrocarbon release is undesirable because of the potential to escalate, and so\nreporting data from minor incidents has also been included in Figure 3 below.\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\nFigure 3.

According to Dr. Andrew Hopkins, major accidents are more difficult to define\nthan, say, a car accident, and they are rare, making it difficult to estimate the number of major accidents\nprevented.488 In addition, based on the data in existence, there is a continued need for improved data\ncollection; key leading performance indicators development and implementation on a global scale would\nprovide an improved glimpse into how safety is being managed for major accident prevention.\nA team of three independent safety experts was asked to conduct an independent evaluation of the\noperational effectiveness of the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority (NOPSA), which was\nestablished in January 2005 to regulate offshore health and safety in Australia (it was superseded by\nNOPSEMA in January 2012). The 2008 report released as a result of the evaluation noted that the team\nof experts received submissions identifying issues surrounding the safety case regime from twelve\nstakeholders, including the Australian Workers Union, the Maritime Union of Australia, and the\nInternational Association of Drilling Contractors. The report states that a majority of the submissions\nexpressed that the safety case regime had “generally been a success…” and “had led to improvements and\nalready brought forth better consistency in many areas….”489 The report noted that there was general\nstakeholder agreement “that the regulatory processes have been improved.”490\nAs mentioned in Section 3.2.1.2 of the report, following the Macondo incident in April 2010, an\nindependent review of the offshore safety case regime in the UK was conducted by a panel consisting of\nthree independent appointees, including Professor Geoffrey Maitland at Imperial College London. A\nreport was published discussing the review in December 2011, and it noted that, while not perfect, the\noffshore safety case regime was “robust and effective at identifying risks and appropriate measures for\nmitigation and response….”491 The report stated the following:\nFrom its analysis of the existing UK framework and the information it\ngleaned from its discussion with those directly involved in the sector\nfrom both an operational and regulatory perspective, the Review\nPanel was reassured that the UK regime already incorporates a\nnumber of positive, key features which were not present in the US at\nthe time of the Macondo incident.

The UK HSE has published reports493 showing significant industry problems with maintenance of\nsafety critical equipment, poor understanding of the potential impact of degrading plant and utility\nsystems on safety critical elements, and lack of understanding of the role of asset integrity and the concept\nof barriers in major hazard risk control. Don’t these reports developed by the UK regulator demonstrate\nthat the safety case is not effective and is not working?\nThe CSB recognizes that there have been critiques of the safety case regime and its implementation. The\nCSB acknowledges that the safety case is not perfect and that no regulatory system will be perfect in its\nimplementation. Some have noted the issue of aging equipment due to many issues, including the harsh\nconditions that exist in the North Sea. Regulators and commissions in the UK have found degradation of\npipes, valves, and other equipment at many facilities due to company deferrals of maintenance,\ninsufficient testing of safety-critical elements, and a continuing industry culture of responding to\ndisasters, rather than anticipating worst-case scenarios. However, the safety case regime’s adaptive\nnature has been able to address these concerns. The HSE has recognized asset integrity management and\nthe issue of ageing equipment as key issues to address in its inspection programs, and has developed\ninternal processes and priorities for these areas.\nIn 2010, the UK HSE initiated Key Programme 4 to address the issue of aging equipment offshore and the\noperation of installations beyond their design life.494 The same year, the HSE published a report intended\n492 Ibid at 3.\n493 The HSE published a report to communicate the results and conclusions of the Asset Integrity Key Programme\ncarried out between 2004 and 2007 by the Health and Safety Executive’s Offshore Division. See\nhttp://www.hse.gov.uk/offshore/kp3.pdf (accessed August 28, 2013).\n494 The report is available at http://www.hse.gov.uk/offshore/ageing/kp4-interim-report.pdf (accessed November 1,\n2013).\n118\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\nto inform industry and aid in the prevention of major accidents entitled Managing Ageing Plant: A\nSummary Guide,495 which provides an overview of ageing plant mechanisms and their management and\npresents the findings of an analysis of loss of containment incidents to indicate the extent to which ageing\nplant equipment may be a factor. This type of programmatic proactive approach and information\ndissemination is lacking in the US both on and offshore.\n6. How have other countries implemented the safety case regime? What challenges do the countries face\nwhen transitioning to a safety case approach?\nFrom the international safety case community, the CSB has found that when transitioning to a safety case\nregime there are many obstacles that may hinder the transition, such as:\n• Major stakeholders not being committed to the process, unconvinced of the need;\n• Lack of understanding that the safety case regime is a “process” to be undertaken by the duty\nholder and the workforce to improve understanding of the hazards, risks, and their controls, and\nto put in place measures for continuous improvement, rather than just creation of a “document”;\n• Lack of sufficient funding by government and industry; and\n• Lack of the necessary legislative timetable.\nThe transition to a safety case regime has significant challenges for both the duty holder and the regulator,\nincluding:\n• The safety case report could be treated as a check-the-box exercise;\n• Documented safety management system does not reflect reality;\n• Poor identification of hazards and risks;\n• Poor understanding of the performance of control systems;\n• Attempting to justify existing controls rather than to seek opportunity to improve;\n• Insufficient workforce involvement in the process;\n• The safety case process is under-resourced;\n• The safety case report is “inaccessible” so the report simply lives on the shelf;\n• The regulator does not use the safety case report to inform the inspection or audit;\n• Limited requirement for the reporting of accidents, dangerous occurrences and precursors\nresulting in lack of comprehensive performance data; and\n• The regulator is under-resourced, technically challenged, poorly trained, has poor systems and\nprocedures, and is inconsistent.\nIn implementing the safety case regime, there should be regard for the regulatory principles and\nframeworks which represent best practice. The underlying principles are:\n• The legislation and regulation should be fit for purpose, not simply superimposed on existing\nprescriptive regulation;\n495 See http://www.hse.gov.uk/research/rrpdf/rr823-summary-guide.pdf (accessed November, 1, 2013).\n119\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\n• Regulation should be effective and efficient; and\n• Industry should move away from a culture of compliance with detailed prescriptive regulation to\none of involving the workforce in understanding the hazards.\nSome significant points worth noting from international experience in setting up the regulation are:\n• Staff should be recruited against detailed job descriptions and should cover the full range of\ntechnical, management and regulatory requirements;\n• Pay rates and terms and conditions should be sufficient to attract highly qualified staff;\n• A competency framework needs to be developed reflecting the required knowledge, skills, and\nexperience required to undertake;\n• Appropriate training programs must be in place;\n• An electronic dedicated safety case assessment procedure which captures the detail of the process\nto be followed and records the background to the decision-making process will be needed. This\nhelps ensure good quality, consistent, and transparent assessment and provides a database of\ninformation which is used for future validation/topic facility inspections. It also provides a\ncomprehensive record of the process which can be used in the event of an appeal against an\nassessment decision;\n• An accident and dangerous occurrence data base will be needed to store knowledge and data to\nprovide reference information and the capacity to analyze trends; and\n• An emergency reporting and response process is necessary to ensure all significant events are\nproperly logged and dealt with.\n120\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\nAppendix D: CSB Staff May 2014 Response to the Board’s Motion\nto Postpone issued on January 15, 2014\nBackground\nOn January 15, 2014, the CSB held a public meeting in Richmond, California, to present the draft\nChevron Regulatory Report for a vote by the Board. In the first CSB Chevron Report (the Chevron\nInterim Report), which was approved by the Board on April 19, 2013, the CSB staff committed to\ninvestigating additional issues which would be presented in a final report on the incident. These issues\nincluded the regulatory oversight of petroleum refineries in California. Due to deployments to West,\nTexas, and Geismar, Louisiana, the CSB Chevron investigation team produced a second interim draft\nreport focused solely on the regulation of petroleum refineries. At the Richmond public meeting, the\nBoard moved to postpone a vote on the draft regulatory report in order for the CSB investigation staff to\naddress additional issues raised concerning regulatory oversight of petroleum refineries and the proposed\nsafety case regime. The CSB staff was given 120 days from the date of the public meeting to respond to\nthe motion.\nI.\n1. Does Cal/OSHA have sufficient authority to require timely abatement of hazards associated\nwith serious and willful violations?\nCSB Investigations Staff Response:\nFollowing the August 6th incident at the Chevron Richmond Refinery, Cal/OSHA cited Chevron for,\namong other things, failing to replace pipe clamps at the refinery, and ordered Chevron to replace those\npipe clamps by a certain date. The CSB Chevron Interim Report states that Chevron has a history of\nfrequently using leak repair clamps to externally stop process fluid leaks, and that following discovery of\nthe leak on the 4-sidecut piping prior to the incident, “Chevron hoped to forestall a shutdown by installing\na leak repair clamp.”496 The CSB determined that Chevron had more than 100 clamps on hydrocarbon\nand other piping components containing hazardous flammable process fluids at the Richmond refinery\nand that reliance on such clamps to mitigate leaks “identifies serious questions about its mechanical\nintegrity program.”497 The interim report, which was approved by the Board on April 19, 2013,\ncommitted to evaluating the Chevron Richmond Refinery’s use of clamps and its mechanical integrity\nprogram as they relate to the refinery’s process safety culture in the final CSB report on the Chevron\nincident.\nA letter written by California Representative George Miller dated January 15, 2014 discussed Chevron’s\nuse of clamps and expressed concern that some of the clamps have not been replaced, and will not be\nreplaced until late 2014. The letter stated that under the California Labor Code, an employer is not\nobligated to correct a Cal/OSHA safety violation if they appeal. According to Representative Miller,\n496 CSB. Chevron Interim Report. April 19, 2013; p 62.\n497 Ibid.\n121\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\nChevron appealed its Cal/OSHA citations on February 19, 2013. In the letter Rep. Miller requested that\ngiven these facts, the CSB investigators should assess the issue of timely abatement, and consider making\nrecommendations to the Legislature and Governor on this matter.\nThe CSB staff notes that while it has already committed to evaluating the use of clamps at the Chevron\nRichmond Refinery as it relates to mechanical integrity and process safety culture, we are not aware of a\ncausal connection between the refinery’s use of the clamps to mitigate leaks and the August 6th incident.\nRegulatory bodies often cite companies for deficiencies following an incident that are not related to that\nincident. However, the CSB is directed under the Clean Air Act to “investigate (or cause to be\ninvestigated), determine and report to the public in writing the facts, conditions, and circumstances and\nthe cause or probable cause” of an accidental release.498 (emphasis added). The CSB’s Board Order\n040, Procedure G: Causal Analysis, discusses requirements of formal analysis tools that identify the\nmultiple causes of an incident, including technical, organizational, and societal causes. Thus, while the\nCSB staff committed to analyzing the issue of clamps at the refinery as it pertains to safety culture, the\nstaff did not analyze the usage of clamps and abatement in its regulatory report, as it was not determined\nto be causal and was therefore not within the scope of the regulatory investigation.\n2. Should Contra Costa County Health Services have direct enforcement authority under the\nIndustrial Safety Ordinance?\nThe CSB staff looked into this matter, including interviewing key personnel, and determined that while\nhaving enforcement power is generally beneficial, a CSB recommendation on the issue is not warranted in\nthis case, as Contra Costa County’s lack of enforcement authority under the ISO is not causal to the\nAugust 6th incident. According to Contra Costa County officials, the inspectors have never gone to the\nDistrict Attorney to enforce the ISO. In addition, these officials have stated to the CSB that the Chevron\nRichmond Refinery has cooperated fully with past recommendations and has addressed any violations\nissued as a result of any audit conducted by Contra Costa County inspectors. While the CSB agrees that\nhaving enforcement power provides the regulator with another tool to ensure compliance with regulations,\nthere is no causal connection to the August 6th incident and therefore no additional recommendation\nregarding this issue is warranted.\n3. Does Contra Costa County Health Services have sufficient resources to conduct\ncomprehensive inspections and retain technically qualified personnel?\nThe report discusses the lack of resources and funding within the Contra Costa Hazardous Materials\nProgram, which has limited its ability to hire additional highly qualified staff to oversee the petroleum\nrefineries in Contra Costa County. The engineers are part of a bargaining unit and their salaries are paid\nthrough the county’s general fund, which has experienced annual budget reductions in the millions. The\nCSB agrees that for a performance based regulatory approach to be effective it is essential to have a well\nfunded, qualified regulator and has therefore added a recommendation to the City of Richmond and\nContra Costa County.\n498 42 U.S.C. §7412 (r)(6)(C)(i) (1990).\n122\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\n4. Does Contra Costa County Health Services have sufficient authority to require facilities to\nundertake feasible risk reduction measures, such as best practices, which go beyond minimum\nregulatory requirements?\nThe draft report discusses on page 89 that Contra Costa engineers conduct CalArp and ISO/RISO audits\nconcurrently at each covered facility generally once every three years. The engineers are only able to\naudit against the regulatory requirements, and while they can issue “consider” action items to the facility\nrecommending actions above and beyond regulatory requirements, they do this very infrequently.\nThe Chevron Interim Report addressed ISO regulatory deficiencies, including the fact that there is no\nrequired implementation of inherent safety (unlike in the safety case). The Interim Report issues\nrecommendations R3, R4 and R6 and R7, which request the City of Richmond and Contra Costa County\nto revise the ISO to require damage mechanism hazard reviews and the documented use of inherently\nsafer systems analysis and the hierarchy of controls “to the greatest extent feasible” in establishing\nsafeguards for identified process hazards. The recommendations note that the goal shall be to drive the\nrisk of major accidents to As Low As Reasonably Practicable, or ALARP.\nThe ISO is currently being revised to implement these recommendations, and should be finalized as early\nas June 2014. The revised regulatory language would require facilities to reduce risk to “the greatest\nextent feasible,” which is a concept that is very similar to ALARP. Contra Costa County will have the\nability to issue guidance that elaborates on what will be required to achieve that standard.\nThe CSB staff believes that these recommendations cover the issue raised in this question, and no\nadditional recommendations are warranted.\nII.\nIn the motion to postpone the Board made the following proposal to have additional questions addressed\nby an expert panel:\nThe CSB staff shall convene a multidisciplinary expert panel (selected by the full Board), similar to\nthe Baker Panel established after the BP Texas City incident, to provide the agency with an\nassessment of the following topics regarding regulating process safety in refineries in California:\n1. To address questions raised in the comments received by the CSB, the panel shall assess the\navailable process safety performance data to evaluate the effectiveness of the safety case regulatory\nmodel for refineries.\n2. Assess the challenges of making safety case operational and effective with regard to the following\ntopics:\na. What is the role of transparency and community involvement under this regime? Are\nsafety case reports made public?\n123\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\nb. How are workers empowered as part of the tripartite model? Have there been\nretaliatory actions taken against workers for their involvement, and what protective\nmeasures are in place?\nc. Are safety committees mandatory or optional in non-union workplaces? How are safety\ncommittee members selected, and under what authority?\nd. Is there a public data base of incident and near miss reporting? How are process safety\nperformance indicators developed and used? Are these made public?\ne. How are standards for minimum levels of risk set (ALARP presumably goes beyond\nminimum levels)?\nf. What are the enforcement methods used by regulators under the safety case?\ng. What are the key transition issues that were addressed with facilities in operation at the\ntime the safety case was adopted?\nIn response to this Board motion the staff has developed a white paper with staff responses to the\nquestions posed by the Board. Additionally, the CSB is planning a public hearing in the Spring of 2015\nto discuss various models, including safety case, for regulating high hazard facility safety.\n124\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\n[This page left intentionally blank.]\n125\nChevron Richmond Refinery Regulatory Report October 2014\n126"}

Report\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nOn Thursday, January 28, 2021, between approximately 8:45 and 10:15 a.m., liquid nitrogen overflowed from\nan immersion freezer located inside the Plant 4 building at the Foundation Food Group (FFG) facility in\nGainesville, Georgia. The release began while maintenance workers were troubleshooting operational issues\nwith the freezer, which was designed and owned by Messer LLC (Messer) and leased to FFG. Once released,\nthe liquid nitrogen quickly vaporized, expanded, and accumulated inside a partially enclosed lower-level room\nthat lacked mechanical ventilation. The two maintenance workers who were troubleshooting the freezer at the\ntime of the release were fatally injured by asphyxiation due to the vaporized liquid nitrogen.\nThe uncontrolled liquid nitrogen release continued, and the two deceased maintenance workers went undetected\nfor 30 to 60 minutes, until another worker went looking for them and saw a four- to five-foot-high vapor cloud\nfilling the room. This worker reported the incident to management, which then initiated an evacuation. During\nthe ensuing building-wide evacuation, at least 14 other FFG employees, including members of management,\nresponded to the incident by either investigating the freezer room or attempting to rescue their coworkers. As a\nresult, four additional FFG employees were fatally injured by asphyxiation, and three other FFG employees and\na firefighter were seriously injured presenting asphyxiation symptoms.\nCourt filings show that after the incident FFG sued its insurance company for damages of roughly $1.7 million.\nMesser reported business and property losses of roughly $245,000.\nSAFETY ISSUES\nThe CSB’s investigation identified the safety issues below.\n• Single Point of Failure. The immersion freezer design included a device called a bubbler tube, which\nwas used to measure the liquid nitrogen level inside the freezer. The bubbler tube was likely bent during\nmaintenance activity, rendering it unable to measure and control the freezer’s liquid nitrogen level. As a\nresult, liquid nitrogen overflowed from the freezer and filled the room with vaporized nitrogen. This\ndesign was vulnerable to a single point of failure. Once the tube became bent, there was nothing else to\nprevent the release of liquid nitrogen. The design team did not adequately consider the consequences of\nthe failure of the bubbler tube—a critical safety component—and did not identify appropriate\nsafeguards to mitigate its potential failure. In addition, during fabrication of the immersion freezer,\nMesser failed to detect a manufacturing defect that exacerbated the potential for the bubbler tube to be\nbent—a missing clamp meant to secure the bubbler tube to the freezer. (Section 4.1)\n• Atmospheric Monitoring and Alarm Systems. There is abundant industry guidance on the importance\nof atmospheric monitoring when the potential for hazardous atmospheres exists. FFG, however, did not\ninstall atmospheric monitoring equipment in the freezer room. As such, there was no equipment\ninstalled to detect the oxygen-deficient atmosphere in the freezer room, automatically shut off the liquid\nnitrogen supply, and notify personnel to evacuate the area. (Section 4.2)\n• Emergency Preparedness. FFG did not inform, train, equip, drill, or otherwise prepare its workforce\nfor a release of liquid nitrogen. FFG’s workforce lacked knowledge of the hazards of nitrogen and its\nability to create an oxygen-deficient atmosphere, were unable to recognize an oxygen-deficient\n7\nInvestigation Report\natmosphere, and lacked any equipment or PPE that would have enabled safe entry into an oxygen-\ndeficient atmosphere. As a result, after the discovery of the first two deceased workers, four other\nemployees who entered the freezer room also died from asphyxiation due to the released nitrogen during\nresponse or rescue attempts. Three other employees responded and were seriously injured. At least\nseven other employees responded and were not seriously injured, but they were at risk of nitrogen\nasphyxiation due to their proximity to the release. FFG also did not proactively interact with local\nemergency responders prior to the incident, despite relying upon them to respond to emergencies at its\nfacility. (Section 4.3)\n• Process Safety Management System. FFG had no documented process safety management policy,\nallowed the job position responsible for safety management to be vacant for more than a year prior to\nthe incident, did not evaluate the process hazards associated with the freezer, lacked written procedures\nand a management of change process, and did not train its workers on the asphyxiation hazards of liquid\nnitrogen. Despite robust industry guidance on process safety management systems, FFG was not\nrequired by law to implement it. As a result of the lack of specific regulations for cryogenic asphyxiants,\nFFG did not implement systems and practices that could have reduced the incident’s severity or\nprevented the accidental release altogether. (Section 4.4)\n• Product Stewardship. Messer owned the liquid nitrogen bulk storage tanks and the Line 4 immersion-\nspiral freezer and leased the equipment to FFG. At the time of the incident, Messer had institutional\nknowledge, experience, policies, and practices for effective product stewardship but applied those\npractices only to the bulk storage tanks and not to the Line 4 freezer process. Throughout its relationship\nwith FFG, Messer had identified issues with FFG’s safety practices and nonconformance to industry\nguidance, but despite FFG’s unsafe practices, Messer continued to supply FFG with liquid nitrogen.\nHad Messer suspended service until FFG corrected known safety deficiencies, this incident may have\nbeen prevented. (Section 4.5)\nCAUSE\nThe CSB determined the cause of the liquid nitrogen release was the failure of the immersion freezer’s liquid\nlevel control system to accurately measure and control the liquid nitrogen level inside the freezer, which resulted\nfrom deformation of the system’s bubbler tube component.\nContributing to the incident were 1) Messer’s design of the freezer, which allowed the failure of a single level\nmeasurement device to result in an uncontrolled loss of containment of liquid nitrogen, 2) FFG’s lack of any\nprocess safety management systems or practices that could have prevented the incident, 3) a lack of regulatory\ncoverage for liquid nitrogen, which enabled FFG to elect not to implement process safety practices that could\nhave prevented the incident, and 4) Messer’s inadequate product stewardship practices, which resulted in Messer\ncontinuing to supply FFG with liquid nitrogen despite FFG’s unsafe practices.\nContributing to the severity of the incident were 1) FFG’s inadequate emergency preparedness, which resulted\nin at least 14 employees responding to the release by entering the freezer room or the surrounding area to\ninvestigate the incident or to attempt to rescue their coworkers, and 2) the absence of atmospheric monitoring\nand alarm devices that could have alerted workers to the presence of a hazardous atmosphere and warned them\nagainst entering it.\n8\nInvestigation Report\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nTo Gold Creek Foods (current owner of the FFG facility)a\n2021-03-I-GA-R1\nInclude in the emergency action program provisions for proactively interacting with and informing local\nemergency response resources of all emergencies at the former FFG Plant 4 facility to which Gold Creek\nexpects them to respond. At a minimum, Gold Creek should:\na) inform local emergency responders of the existence, nature, and location of hazardous substances at its\nfacilities, including liquid nitrogen;\nb) inform local emergency responders of the location of emergency-critical equipment such as bulk storage\ntanks, points of use, isolation valves, E-stop switches, and any other emergency equipment or systems\nwith which emergency responders may need to interact; and,\nc) provide local emergency responders with information, such as facility plot plans, engineering drawings,\nor other information needed to mount an effective emergency response.\nTo Messer LLCb\n2021-03-I-GA-R2\nUpdate the company product stewardship policy to:\na) include participation by Messer in customers’ process hazard analyses (PHAs). The policy should\nrequire that these PHAs be conducted in a manner which conforms with CCPS Guidelines for Hazard\nEvaluation Procedures prior to the startup of a cryogenic freezing process;\nb) require verification that proper signage, in accordance with CGA P-76 Hazards of Oxygen-Deficient\nAtmospheres, is displayed on and/or near equipment; and,\nc) require a facility and/or equipment siting review to ensure that emergency shutoff devices, including E-\nstops, are located such that they can be safely actuated during a release of liquid nitrogen.\na\nGold Creek has developed emergency response procedures that could have reduced the severity of this incident. Consequently, the CSB\nmakes no recommendations to Gold Creek pertaining to the development of emergency preparedness policies or employee training for\nits emergency action program. Additionally, as of this report’s publication, there are no liquid nitrogen freezing processes at the former\nFFG Plant 4 building which Gold Creek now operates. Consequently the CSB makes no recommendation to Gold Creek related to\nventilation or process safety management practices for liquid nitrogen processes.\nb\nAfter the incident Messer revised its freezer design to include multiple layers of protection against liquid nitrogen overflow. Messer\nalso revised its Quality Control process and procedures to require verification of the presence of the necessary bubbler tube clamps and\nreordered the sequence of inspection steps to facilitate this verification.

(Prime-Pak)a and Victory Processing, Inc. (Victory Processing)b in September 2020.\nPrior to the merger, the two companies had been partners in a joint-venture since 2018; Prime-Pak operated in\nwhat became known as the FFG Plant 4 building, discussed further in Section 1.2 below, across the street from\nVictory Processing.\nAt the time of the incident, approximately 135 employees worked in the FFG Plant 4 building. The majority of\nthe FFG workforce did not speak English as their primary language or were non-English speaking.\nFollowing the incident, in October 2021, Gold Creek Foods (Gold Creek) acquired FFG.\n1.1.2 MESSER LLC\nMesser LLC (Messer) was formed in March 2019, when Messer Group and CVC Capital Partners Fund VII\n(CVC) acquired most of the North American gases business of Linde plc (Linde) [1].c Messer, which is\nheadquartered in Bridgewater, New Jersey, is an industrial and specialty gases technology and applications\nsupplier for the industrial, food, medical, chemical, and electronics industries [2]. Messer supplied bulk liquid\nnitrogen for FFG and designedd and owned the liquid nitrogen immersion-spiral freezer system, which was\nleased to and operated by FFG to freeze poultry products.\n1.2 LIQUID NITROGEN FREEZING AT FFG\nFollowing the merger between Prime-Pak and Victory Processing, FFG owned four poultry processing plants in\nGainesville, Georgia. The former Prime-Pak building became FFG Plant 4, which housed five production lines,\ndenoted as Lines 1 through 5.\nPrior to 2020, Prime-Pak and FFG utilized ammonia freezer systems in Plant 4 to freeze poultry products. In\nearly 2020, FFG began introducing Messer’s liquid nitrogen freezer systems into Plant 4 to increase production\ncapacity.e FFG and Messer worked collaboratively for several months to prepare for the addition of the liquid\na\nPrime-Pak was formed as Milton’s Portion-Pak Meats, Inc. in 1973.\nb\nVictory Processing was formed in 2006.\nc\nLinde was required to divest this business as part of its 2018 merger with Praxair, Inc. [49].\nd\nThe immersion-spiral freezer was designed by Linde prior to the Messer acquisition, at which point Messer acquired Linde’s North\nAmerican freezer assets.\ne\nBy transitioning from the ammonia spiral freezer to the liquid nitrogen immersion-spiral freezer process, FFG estimated that it would\nobtain a 7% increase in the yield of its diced product and eliminate operational issues experienced with the ammonia freezer.\n13\nInvestigation Report\nnitrogen freezer systems. Messer and FFGa entered into a product supply agreement for the lease of two 13,000-\ngallon bulk liquid nitrogen tanks, routine liquid nitrogen supply, and a nitrogen spiral freezer. The storage tanks\nwere installed outside the FFG facility, and the spiral freezer was installed on Line 2 in Plant 4 in May 2020.\nThe Line 2 process was commissioned into service later that month.\nIn July 2020, the agreement was amended to include the lease of one additional 13,000-gallon bulk liquid\nnitrogen tank and a liquid nitrogen immersion-spiral freezer to be used on Line 4. Installation of the additional\nstorage tank and immersion-spiral freezer began on December 5, 2020.,\nOn December 13, 2020, FFG added walls to the Line 4 freezer room where the freezer was installed to separate\nthe immersion-spiral freezer from the adjacent areas of the plant. Additionally, FFG constructed a “clean room”\nopposite of the equipment (Figure 1).b Shortly thereafter, on December 16, 2020, the immersion-spiral freezer\ninstallation was completed, and production on Line 4 commenced the following day, approximately five weeks\nprior to the fatal incident.\n1.3 LINE 4 FREEZING PROCESS\nThe FFG Plant 4 building (Figure 1) consisted of five production lines that made various cooked, partially\ncooked, and marinated chicken products [3]. Conveyor belts transferred chicken through production equipment,\nsuch as ovens, fryers, freezers, and baggers, on each production line. Line 4, where the release occurred,\nprocessed cooked chicken products.\nThe Plant 4 building was separated into two processing areas: the “raw” area and the “Ready-To-Eat” (RTE)\narea.c The Line 4 process began in the raw area with marination and cooking, then continued to the RTE area,\nwhich contained a dicer, freezer, and packaging equipment. Workers measured product temperatures at various\nstages throughout the line to ensure that the product met food safety specifications. Production stopped at the\nend of each workday and re-started the following morning.\na\nAt the time that the product supply agreement was made, FFG had yet to be formed, so Prime-Pak Foods is listed on the agreement.\nb\nThis was a separate project from the Line 4 freezer project. The clean room, also known as the smock changing area, would allow\nworkers to cross between the raw and RTE areas (Section 1.3) without having to walk around the building. The new clean room was not\nyet commissioned at the time of the incident.\nc\nRTE is defined by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as food for which it is reasonably foreseeable will be eaten without\nfurther processing that would significantly minimize biological hazards [48]. The plant is separated into the two processing areas to\nminimize or prevent the contamination of RTE foods with disease-causing bacteria, such as Listeria [53].\n14\nInvestigation Report\nFigure 1. Plot plan of the FFG Plant 4 building. The yellow line indicates the Line 4 process flow on the day of\nthe incident. (Credit: FFG with annotations by CSB)\n15\nInvestigation Report\nThe Messer Line 4 liquid nitrogen immersion-spiral freezera process (Figure 2) occurred in two stages. In the\nfirst stage, a conveyor belt carried the fully cooked diced chicken into an immersion freezer where it was\npartially frozen in a -320°F (-196°C) liquid nitrogen bath. The chicken then moved through a transition box to\nthe second stage, where a conveyor belt carried the partially frozen diced chicken through the spiral freezer as\ninternal fans circulated vaporized liquid nitrogen within the freezer to complete the freezing process. The frozen\nchicken exited the spiral freezer and was packaged and shipped to customers.\nFigure 2. Conceptual diagram of the Line 4 liquid nitrogen freezing system, not drawn to scale. (Credit: Messer,\nannotations by CSB)\nExhaust systems connected to both the immersion and spiral freezers directed the nitrogen gas from inside the\nfreezers to outside the building through discharge ducting on the roof.\nControl valves regulated the flow of liquid nitrogen from storage tanks outside the building through piping along\nthe roof and into each freezer. FFG workers used a computer control system with touch screens, called a Human\nMachine Interface (HMI), to set operating parameters for the freezer system, such as the liquid nitrogen level\ninside the immersion freezer, conveyor belt speeds, and exhaust fan speeds. The computer control system\nprogramming included safety interlocks to automatically prevent inadvertent, hazardous liquid nitrogen releases,\nwhich could be activated either by the control system measuring a high liquid level or by pushing emergency\nstop (E-stop) buttons located on the freezer exterior. The control system measured the liquid level in the\nimmersion freezer using a device called the bubbler tube, which is discussed in further detail in Section 3.\nTo enable access to the inside of the immersion freezer, the freezer was also equipped with a lid that could be\nraised, and the transition box had a door that could be opened. The lid and the door were equipped with\npermissive proximity switches, or safety switches; as designed, when the lid and door were closed, the safety\nswitches would enable the freezer to operate normally. If the safety switches lost proximity (meaning that the\ndoor was open and/or the lid was raised), the freezer system was designed to shut off liquid nitrogen supply to\nthe freezers and to increase the speed of the nitrogen exhaust fans.\na\nThe immersion-spiral freezer consisted of two discrete freezers—an immersion freezer and a spiral freezer—connected in series.\n16\nInvestigation Report\n1.4 LINE 4 FREEZER ROOM\nFigure 3 below illustrates the layout of the FFG Line 4 freezer room.\nFigure 3. Diagram of the FFG Line 4 freezer room. (Credit: CSB)\nIn total, the room had four openings. On the southeast wall, there was an elevated opening through which\nconveyor belts brought product from the oven room into the freezer room. Also on the southeast wall was a\nlarge open doorway into the packaging area. Both of these openings on the southeast wall were elevated roughly\nfive feet from the floor of the freezer room. On the southwest wall, there was a large open doorway leading to\nthe warehouse and loading dock area. This doorway contained heavy plastic curtains separating the freezer room\nfrom the warehouse and loading dock. On the northwest wall, there was a single door that separated the freezer\nroom from the clean room. There were no openings in the northeast wall.\nThe rooms adjacent to the Line 4 freezer room on the northeast and southeast sides were elevated roughly five\nfeet above the floor level in the freezer room (Figure 4). The adjacent rooms on the southwest and northwest\nsides were at the same floor elevation as the freezer room. Thus, the room was recessed below adjacent rooms\non two sides and level with the adjacent rooms on the two other sides. Ultimately, below the elevation of five\nfeet, the room was very nearly fully enclosed. The only openings in the room below five feet of elevation were a\n17\nInvestigation Report\nstandard-size door on the northwest wall, and a large doorway on the southwest wall that was partially\nobstructed by heavy plastic strip curtains.\nFigure 4. Photo showing difference in elevation between Line 4 freezer room and the adjacent rooms on the\nnortheast and southeast sides. (Credit: CSB)\nAir circulated through the room through the four openings described above. The room had no mechanical\nventilation or heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), although the immersion-spiral freezers\ncontained exhaust systems designed to remove the vaporized nitrogen from the normal operation of the freezers\n(described previously in Section 1.3 and Figure 2).\n1.5 DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES BETWEEN FFG AND MESSER\nAs part of FFG’s and Messer’s supply agreement, Messer retained ownershipa of the bulk liquid nitrogen tanks,\nthe Line 2 spiral freezer, and the Line 4 immersion-spiral freezer equipment. Messer also supplied FFG with\nliquid nitrogen and maintained and inspected the bulk tanks. FFG was responsible for maintaining the\nequipment site; ensuring the site complied with safety and environmental regulations; providing necessary\na\nFFG leased the equipment from Messer.\n18\nInvestigation Report\nutilities, piping, and connections for use of the equipment; providing adequate security; and maintaining freezer\nequipment per Messer instructions.\nThe companies summarized the division of responsibilities as shown in Figure 5.\nFigure 5. Liquid nitrogen freezer division of responsibilities between Messer and FFG (Credit:\nFFG, annotations by CSB)\n1.6 LIQUID NITROGEN\n1.6.1 PROPERTIES\nNitrogen is a colorless, odorless, non-flammable, non-toxic, inert gas that is abundant in air.a Under specific\ntemperature and pressure conditions,b Nitrogen is a cryogenic liquid, which is also colorless, odorless, non-\nflammable, and non-toxic.\nLiquid nitrogen boils at -320 °F (-196 °C) at atmospheric pressure. It produces large volumes of nitrogen gas\nwhen it vaporizes [4]. Nitrogen gas readily mixes with air at room temperature; however, cold nitrogen gas is\na\nNitrogen makes up about 78% of the earth’s atmosphere [52].\nb\nA cryogenic liquid is a refrigerated liquefied gas with a boiling point less than -130°F (-90°C) at atmospheric pressure [5, p. 2].\n19\nInvestigation Report\ndenser than air and can settle and collect in low areas [4]. Contact with liquid nitrogen or cold nitrogen gas can\ncause severe cold burns, frostbite, and hypothermia.a Prolonged breathing of extremely cold gas may damage\nlung tissue.\n1.6.2 ASPHYXIATION\nLiquid nitrogen has a liquid-to-gas expansion ratio of 1 to 696 at 70°F (21°C), meaning that nitrogen gas will\nexpand to fill the volume of a space 696 times greater than its volume when in the liquid phase [5, p. 5]. High\nconcentrations of nitrogen gas in an enclosed area will displace oxygen, creating an oxygen-deficient\natmosphere. Atmospheres containing less than 19.5% oxygen are considered oxygen-deficient and can cause a\nrange of effects on the human body, as shown in Figure 6. Atmospheres containing very low oxygen\nconcentrations can lead to asphyxiation, an effect in which the body receives inadequate oxygen, resulting in\nloss of consciousness or death [6].b At these very low oxygen concentrations (i.e., less than 10%), exposure may\nresult in the rapid loss of consciousness without warning [7], which can occur in as few as one or two breaths [6,\np. 4].\nFigure 6. Effects of oxygen deficiency on the human body [8, p. 3]. (Credit: CSB)\n1.7 LIQUID NITROGEN IN FOOD PROCESSING\nCryogenic freezers using inert gases, such as liquid nitrogen, have become common in the food processing\nindustry due to their relatively low capital investment, smaller size, and faster freezing time compared with\na\nSymptoms of hypothermia include a slowing down of physical and mental responses, unreasonable behavior, speech or vision\ndifficulty, stumbling, and cramps and shivers.\nb\nTypically, air contains about 21% oxygen [52]. Symptoms of asphyxia may include rapid breathing, nausea, vomiting, inability to\nmove, convulsive movements, collapse, abnormal pulse, rapid fatigue, faulty judgment, insensitivity to pain, and abnormal emotions.\n20\nInvestigation Report\nammonia-based mechanical freezers [9]. In addition to Messer, several companies manufacture cryogenic\nfreezers for the food processing industry comparable to the one discussed in this report.\nCryogenic immersion-spiral freezers are used in various food freezing applications, including the freezing of\npoultry, beef, diced luncheon meats, pizza toppings, marinated meats and vegetables, shrimp, and seafood fillets\n[10].\nWithin the United States, at least 220 poultry processing facilities handle cryogenic liquids. In June 2021, the\nU.S. Poultry & Egg Association polled poultry processing facilities and found that 74% of the respondents use\ncryogenic freezers, with 22% using liquid nitrogen, 33% using carbon dioxide, and 19% using both liquid\nnitrogen and carbon dioxide, as shown in Figure 7.\nFigure 7. Cryogenic use in the poultry industry. (Credit: U.S. Poultry & Egg Association, formatted by CSB)\n1.8 REGULATORY COVERAGE\nThe U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection\nAgency (EPA) do not define liquid nitrogen as a highly hazardous chemical or extremely hazardous substance.\nConsequently, OSHA’s Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA’s Risk\nManagement Program (RMP) rule (40 CFR 68) did not apply to FFG’s liquid nitrogen process [11, 12].\nAlthough FFG also utilized anhydrous ammonia (which is regulated by PSM and RMP) in processes separate\nfrom the Line 4 liquid nitrogen process, FFG asserted that its ammonia processes were also not covered under\n21\nInvestigation Report\nthe regulations because FFG’s ammonia processes were not interconnected and each utilized a quantity of\nanhydrous ammonia less than the quantity required to trigger regulatory coverage. Various other regulations\napplied to FFG, and they are discussed in the relevant portions of the report below.\n1.9 DESCRIPTION OF SURROUNDING AREA\nFigure 8 shows the FFG facility and depicts the area within one, three, and five miles of the facility boundary.\nSummarized demographic data for the approximately one-mile vicinity of the FFG facility are shown below in\nTable 1. There are over 26,000 people residing in over 7,600 housing units, most of which are single family\nunits, within one mile of the FFG facility.

Messer returned to the FFG facility on multiple occasions to\ntroubleshoot these operational issues, including problems with belt loading, liquid nitrogen level control, and\nfreezing.,\nWith regard to the belt loading issues, diced chicken product was shifting unevenly to one side of the conveyor\nbelt as it traveled through the immersion freezer to the spiral freezer. Messer thought that the flow of liquid\nnitrogen into the immersion freezer tub was potentially pushing the chicken product to the opposite side of the\nconveyor belt, causing the uneven belt loading. Accordingly, on January 23, 2021, Messer modified the design\nof the end of the liquid nitrogen inlet piping into the immersion freezer to slow the velocity of liquid nitrogen\nentering the immersion tub.b At the time of the incident, Messer and FFG had resolved most, but not all, uneven\nbelt loading issues in the freezer system.\nFFG also reported to Messer that it believed that the liquid nitrogen level indicated on the control panel was\nlower than the expected level given the specified level setpoint. In an attempt to address the perceived level\ncontrol discrepancy, on January 23, 2021, Messer replaced the liquid nitrogen control valve and transducer on\nthe immersion freezer. At the time of the incident, Messer believed the liquid nitrogen level control issues had\nbeen resolved, but Messer and FFG were continuing to make other adjustments to the system.,c,\na\nThe Census Bureau reports that the 2021 per capita income for the United States is $41,285 [54].\nb\nMesser also re-centered the conveyor belt in the immersion freezer and added product guides to the belt to address the belt loading\nissues.\nc\nThe liquid nitrogen control valve uses a level set point to determine appropriate valve position to control liquid nitrogen flow into the\nfreezer.\n23\nInvestigation Report\nAlso, beginning two days prior to the incident, FFG experienced issues when the immersion-spiral freezer was\nnot fully freezing the diced chicken product. FFG employees stopped Line 4 production operations multiple\ntimes to troubleshoot the problem. On January 26, 2021, Messer was on-site to witness FFG’s attempt to process\nthe diced product. Based on observations that day, the liquid nitrogen level in the immersion freezer was\nlowered to avoid uneven belt loading, which Messer suspected was causing the freezing issues.\nThe next day, on January 27, 2021, FFG continued to experience freezing issues. FFG increased the liquid level\nin the immersion freezer in an attempt to resolve the problem, but this action did not resolve the issue.\nSubsequently, an FFG maintenance worker reported to management that he believed the liquid nitrogen level\nwas too low. As a result, the manager called Messer for guidance. Messer recommended that FFG further\nincrease the nitrogen level in the freezer and provided FFG with the username and password required to modify\nthis parameter in the system. Production on the immersion-spiral freezer resumed that afternoon and continued\nthrough the end of the workday.\n2.2 DAY OF INCIDENT\n2.2.1 LIQUID NITROGEN RELEASE\nOn January 28, 2021, operations on Line 4 commenced at approximately 7:16 a.m. Continuing the trend from\nthe previous days, soft, partially-frozen chicken product was observed coming out of the immersion-spiral\nfreezer., As a result, Line 4 stopped processing chicken at approximately 8:14 a.m. so that maintenance\npersonnel could troubleshoot the issue. At approximately 8:20 a.m., the Line 4 Packaging Supervisora instructed\nthe Line 4 workers to go on break while maintenance workers attempted to resolve the freezing issue. The\nmaintenance workers conducted the maintenance without shutting down the freezer and with the transition box\ndoor and immersion freezer lid safety switches intentionally bypassed.\nThe U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) determined that, likely while the Line 4\nworkers were on break, the bubbler tube in the immersion freezer somehow became bent, thereby preventing the\nfreezer’s liquid nitrogen level control system from working properly (described further in Section 3). The liquid\nnitrogen level then increased in an uncontrolled manner, and liquid nitrogen overflowed from the immersion\nfreezer, filling the freezer room with vaporized nitrogen that displaced the room’s oxygen.\nAfter about 20 minutes, at approximately 8:40 a.m., the Line 4 workers returned from break. At this time the\nworkers noticed a cloud of white fog coming from the Line 4 freezer room but took no further action. According\nto one employee, because workers regularly observed white fog in the freezer room, they did not believe there\nwas a problem. By 9:40 a.m., having not heard from the Line 4 Packaging Supervisor for over an hour, one of\nthe Line 4 workers decided to look for him. The Line 4 worker entered the Line 4 freezer room through an\nelevated opening,b pictured in Figure 3 and Figure 9.\na\nThe Line 4 Packaging Supervisor was later found fatally injured.\nb\nChicken enters the freezer room via conveyor belt through this opening. The bottom edge of this opening is elevated approximately 4\nfeet and 9 inches above the freezer room floor. This opening was not intended for human use as a passageway and was intended only to\nallow for the conveyor belts to enter the freezer room, and to allow for some make-up ventilation. The Line 4 worker crouched down\nand crawled through the opening.\n24\nInvestigation Report\nFigure 9. Line 4 immersion-spiral freezer in Line 4 freezer room several hours after the incident. (Credit: Hall\nCounty Fire Services, annotations by CSB)\nThe Line 4 worker observed a dense white cloud approximately four feet high filling the room.a She also saw\none of the maintenance workers lying motionless on the ground in front of the conveyor belt. The Line 4 worker\nexited the freezer room by crawling back through the elevated opening and returned to where the other Line 4\nworkers were congregated in the RTE area. She informed the other workers of what she saw and then crawled\nthrough the elevated opening again, this time with another worker to confirm her observations. The Line 4\nworkers again returned to the area where the other workers were congregated and then left to locate the Line 1\nPackaging Supervisor to inform him about what they had observed.\n2.2.2 INCIDENT RESPONSE\nBecause FFG did not have a surveillance system, the only evidence available to the CSB to use to reconstruct\nresponse activities were the firsthand accounts of the employees who were not fatally injured during the\na\nCold nitrogen gas could create a fog cloud of condensed moisture in the air. This white cloud may obscure visibility [7].\n25\nInvestigation Report\nincident. The CSB was not able to fully account for the actions of the six fatally injured employees and was also\nnot able to fully establish the chronological order of the events employees described.\nAt approximately 9:55 a.m., upon hearing what the Line 4 workers saw in the freezer room, the Line 1\nPackaging Supervisor escorted the Line 1 and Line 4 workers from the building.a The Line 1 Packaging\nSupervisor was subsequently seen re-entering the building.b Around the same time, other line supervisors began\nevacuating the rest of the Plant 4 employees from the building and notified management about the emergency.\nApproximately 130 workers were evacuated from the building.\nDuring the evacuation, at least 14 FFG employees responded to the Line 4 freezer area to try to determine what\nhappened or attempt rescue efforts. Of the employees that responded to the area, four were fatally injured, three\nwere seriously injured, and at least seven sustained minor injuries or were uninjured.\nAfter hearing about an issue in the Line 4 freezer room, the Production Logistics Manager proceeded to the area\nand discovered the Line 4 Packaging Supervisor unconscious in the shipping area adjacent to the Line 4 freezer\nroom. The Production Logistics Manager attempted to move the Line 4 Packaging Supervisor to the loading\ndock but became affected by the nitrogen vapors and retreated to the clean room, which was adjacent to the Line\n4 freezer room. The Production Logistics Manager leaned against the clean room wall and became unconscious\nfrom his exposure to nitrogen.\nAround the same time, the Maintenance Manager arrived at the clean room area to assess the situation. He\nobserved a Line 4 production worker lying unconscious on the floor. He bent down and attempted to remove her\nfrom the area but was also affected by the liquid nitrogen vapors. He reported stumbling and nearly fainting\nbefore retreating to exit the building. Realizing that there was a liquid nitrogen release, the Maintenance\nManager and two other FFG employees proceeded to the liquid nitrogen storage tanks located at the front of the\nbuilding to manually shut off the liquid nitrogen supply.\nAt 10:11 a.m., the Director of Prepared Foods Operations called 911 to report the incident.c During the 911 call,\nanother FFG employee activated the Plant 4 fire alarm near the front of the building. After making the initial\n911 call, the Director of Prepared Foods Operations proceeded to the Line 4 freezer room and called the\nEnvironmental Health and Safety (EHS)/Wastewater Manager and Senior Vice President of Operations to\ninform them of the situation. These three managers met and proceeded to the clean room adjacent to the Line 4\nfreezer room where they discovered the Production Logistics Manager leaning against the wall, unconscious, as\nwell as two other FFG employees (the Line 1 Packaging Supervisor and the Line 4 production worker whom the\nMaintenance Manager attempted to rescue) lying unconscious on the floor. In response, the three managers\npulled the Production Logistics Managerd from the clean room to the loading dock at the back of the building.\nFirefighters from Hall County Fire Rescue arrived on the scene at around 10:18 a.m., at which time other FFG\nemployees had already moved the Line 4 Packaging Supervisor out of the affected area. Wearing self-contained\nbreathing apparatus (SCBA), the emergency responders entered the Line 4 freezer room and encountered a four-\na\nLine 1 quality assurance records indicate that the last temperature reading was taken at 9:54 a.m.\nb\nThe Line 1 Packaging Supervisor was later found fatally injured.\nc\nThe Director of Prepared Foods Operations called 911 after receiving a call from the Production Logistics Manager who had\nencountered the Line 4 Packaging Supervisor in the shipping area adjacent to the Line 4 freezer room.\nd\nThe Production Logistics Manager survived the incident but spent two days recovering in the hospital.\n26\nInvestigation Report\nfoot-tall white cloud that obscured their visibility in the room. Floor temperatures in the room measured less\nthan -100°F (-73°C). Emergency responders pulled the two maintenance workers and the Plant 4\nSuperintendenta from the Line 4 freezer room and subsequently removed the Line 1 Packaging Supervisor and\nthe Line 4 production workerb from the clean room. At 10:36 a.m., one of the firefighters activated two of the\nimmersion-spiral freezer’s E-stop buttons.\n2.3 INCIDENT CONSEQUENCES\nFive FFG employees died at the FFG facility.c Another died later, after being taken to the hospital. Following\nevacuation from the facility, several additional FFG employees experienced symptoms consistent with\nasphyxiation, including dizziness, headaches, nausea, and fainting. Many of the employees experiencing these\nsymptoms were treated by paramedics onsite; however, seven FFG employees were transported by ambulance\nand three were transported privately into the local hospital for evaluation and treatment. Of the 10 employees\nthat went to the hospital, six were treated in the emergency room and released later the same day, three were\nadmitted, and one was pronounced dead in the emergency room.\nAdditionally, four of the five emergency responders who entered the building wearing SCBA were also\ntransported to the hospital after experiencing dizziness, shortness of breath, and abdominal pain. Three of the\nemergency responders were treated in the emergency room and released the same day; the fourth was released\nthe following day.\nUltimately, the liquid nitrogen release in the FFG Line 4 freezer room fatally injured six FFG employees (the\ntwo maintenance workers, the Lines 1 and 4 Packaging Supervisors, the Plant 4 Superintendent, and a Line 4\nworker). Autopsy results revealed that all six employees asphyxiated. The incident also resulted in the serious\ninjury of three FFG employees and one firefighter.\nCourt filings show that after the incident FFG sued its insurance company for damages of roughly $1.7 million.\nMesser reported business and property losses of roughly $245,000.\na\nThe Plant 4 Superintendent was seen “late in the 9:00 hour” by the Director of Prepared Foods Operations. According to the Director,\nthe Superintendent entered the Director’s office and informed him of “a problem and [that] he was going to go check it out.”\nb\nThis worker was alive but in critical condition when she was removed from the building. She was transported to the hospital and died in\nthe emergency room.\nc\nFive of the fatal injuries occurred at the facility; the sixth fatal injury occurred in the emergency room.\n27\nInvestigation Report\n3 TECHNICAL ANALYSIS\nAfter the incident, the CSB examined the immersion freezer. Part of the examination involved raising the freezer\nlid and conducting a visual examination inside the freezer. The CSB found the bubbler tube bent, as shown in\nFigure 10.\nFigure 10. Immersion freezer bubbler tube, as found during the post-incident examination of the freezer. As\ndesigned, the tube should be pointing straight downward. (Credit: CSB)\nAs discussed previously, the immersion freezer was designed to submerge product in a bath of liquid nitrogen,\nmaintaining a user-specified liquid height in the bath. Messer’s predecessor, Linde, designed the immersion\nfreezer with a liquid level measurement device called a bubbler tube.a As shown in Figure 11, a bubbler tube\nworks by maintaining a constant flow rate of vapor through the tube and into the liquid and measuring the\ndifferential pressure between the liquid and atmospheric pressure [11, p. 113]. The immersion freezer control\nsystem then used that differential pressure measurement to calculate the liquid level in the bath and would\nchange the position of the liquid nitrogen flow control valve to maintain the liquid level at the user-specified\nsetpoint. Messer also equipped the freezer with a high-level safety interlock that when activated was designed to\na\nAlso referred to as a “dip tube” [11, p. 113].\n28\nInvestigation Report\nclose valves to shut off the flow of additional liquid nitrogen into the freezer, shown below in Figure 12. The\nlevel control loop and the high-level safety interlock both used the bubbler tube as the input sensor.\nFigure 11. Simplified conceptual diagram of the immersion freezer level control and high-level safety interlock\nsystem. Not drawn to scale. (Credit: CSB)\nFigure 12. Simplified conceptual diagram showing the normal function of the immersion freezer high-level\nsafety interlock. Not drawn to scale. (Credit: CSB)\nThe CSB tested the functionality of the immersion freezer level control system after the incident. The test\ninvolved filling the immersion tub with water, with the intent of determining 1) whether liquid would overflow\nfrom the freezer, 2) the location from which the liquid would overflow, and 3) the position of the tip of the bent\nbubbler tube relative to the overflow liquid level in the tub.\nDuring the test, the CSB documented the following conditions, pictured below in Figure 13 and illustrated in\nFigure 14:\n29\nInvestigation Report\n• Water overflowed from the inlet side of the freezer.\n• The overflow liquid level was lower than the elevation of the tip of the bent bubbler tube.\n• The freezer level control system measured no liquid level during the test, and the system called for the\nmaximum flow of liquid for the duration of the test.\nFigure 13. Water overflowing from the immersion freezer tub during post-incident overflow test. (Credit: CSB)\nDuring the incident, because the tip of the tube was bent above the overflow level, the level control system\nwould have incorrectly measured no liquid level and would have continued calling for additional liquid nitrogen\neven though the immersion tub overflowed. Also, because the level measurement would have been artificially\nlow, the high-level interlock would not have functioned correctly (as illustrated in Figure 14). The CSB\nexamined the freezer alarm and event log and confirmed that no high-level event was recorded by the freezer\ncontrol system during the incident. The CSB concludes that liquid nitrogen overflowed from the immersion\nfreezer. The liquid nitrogen overflow was caused by the failure of the freezer’s level control and high-level\nsafety interlock systems.\n30\nInvestigation Report\nFigure 14. Simplified conceptual diagram showing the failure state of the immersion freezer level control\nsystem. Not drawn to scale. (Credit: CSB)\nThe CSB conducted a second overflow test using an as-designed exemplar bubbler tube in place of the bent\nincident tube. Both the level control and high-level interlock systems operated as designed (as shown in Figure\n12), indicating that during the incident there was likely nothing preventing the correct function of any of the\nlevel control or interlock equipment other than the bent bubbler tube. The CSB concludes that the failure of the\nfreezer’s level control and high-level safety interlock systems was caused by the deformation of the bubbler\ntube.\nThe immersion freezer level control system operated as designed (and the freezer did not overflow) in the days\nleading up to the incident including up until 8:14 a.m. on the morning of the incident when production was\nstopped and the freezer was turned over to maintenance. Therefore, the CSB concludes that the bubbler tube was\nlikely bent on the morning of the incident during maintenance troubleshooting activities, likely between 8:20\na.m. and approximately 9:30 a.m. However, there was insufficient evidence to determine exactly when the tube\nwas bent. Therefore, the CSB was not able to determine precisely when the uncontrolled release began.\nThere was insufficient evidence to determine how the bubbler tube was bent. The CSB considered several\ncompeting hypotheses, including 1) intentional or unintentional human manipulation of the tube by hand or\nusing various tools, 2) frozen product impacting the tube and bending it over time, and 3) a mass of frozen\nproduct becoming wedged between the tube and the wall of the immersion freezer or the conveyor belt.\nVarious hypotheses were tested extensively by the CSB, Messer, and FFG. Though several of the tests produced\nresults similar to the as-found condition of the incident tube, none of the tests reproduced the exact state in\nwhich the incident tube was found (such as the degree of the bend, the direction of the bend, or the presence or\nabsence of certain “witness marks,” which are specific impressions such as scratches and dents left in the metal).\nAs a result, the CSB was not able to definitively determine how the tube was bent.\nThere was also insufficient evidence to determine the actions that the two maintenance workers took during their\ntroubleshooting efforts, or the sequence of events that took place in the freezer room between when the freezer\n31\nInvestigation Report\nwas turned over from operations to maintenance and when the Line 4 workers first identified the emergency.\nBecause it was impossible to determine 1) when and how the tube was bent, 2) what actions the maintenance\nworkers took, 3) whether the workers were aware of the bent tube, 4) whether the workers were aware of the\nrising level of liquid nitrogen in the freezer, or 5) whether they were aware of the hazard that the rising liquid\nlevel presented, the CSB could not determine whether the two maintenance workers had sufficient awareness,\ntime, and ability to avert the release by activating an E-stop or to escape the room safely prior to the loss of\ncontainment. Messer trained the workers to operate and maintain the freezer, and thus the workers may have\nbeen able to recognize the freezer’s improper function and may have been able to activate an E-stop to avert the\noverflow. Ultimately, however, the CSB could not determine whether the workers were aware of the impending\nrelease, and the workers did not activate an E-stop or escape the room.\nThe Maintenance Manager told the CSB that he manually closed the liquid nitrogen bulk storage tank discharge\nvalves (Section 2.2.2), but he was unable to identify at what time he did so. Based on his and others’ accounts of\nevents, and a 911 call he made at 10:18 a.m., the CSB estimates that the Maintenance Manager closed the valves\nat approximately 10:15 a.m.a The CSB concludes that the uncontrolled release of liquid nitrogen likely ceased at\napproximately 10:15 a.m. when the bulk storage tank manually-operated discharge valves, located outside the\nbuilding, were closed.\nMesser reported that roughly 6,300 gallons of liquid nitrogen flowed to the Line 4 immersion-spiral freezer\ncombination between 8:21 a.m. and 10:51 a.m.b Not all the liquid nitrogen flow that Messer reported would have\nreleased, as the system split the total flow between the immersion and the spiral freezers. The CSB concludes\nthat at most, approximately 6,300 gallons (approximately 42,400 pounds) of liquid nitrogen released from the\nFFG Line 4 immersion freezer, though the actual released quantity was likely less. There was insufficient\nevidence to determine the exact quantity of released liquid nitrogen because it was not possible to determine\nwhen the release began.\nThe Georgia Bureau of Investigation determined that all six fatally injured employees asphyxiated. As discussed\nin Section 1.4, the freezer room was partially recessed, nearly fully enclosed below five feet of elevation, and\nthe room was ventilated only by the building’s make-up air system. Cold nitrogen vapors are heavier than air,\nand numerous employees and first responders reported seeing a thick, visible cloud of vapor roughly four to five\nfeet high in the freezer room.c The CSB concludes that the released liquid nitrogen vaporized, collected in the\nfreezer room, and produced an oxygen-deficient atmosphere inside the room.\na\nThe freezer event log shows that the E-stop was activated at 10:36 a.m., and so at the latest, the uncontrolled flow of liquid nitrogen to\nthe immersion freezer would have ceased at 10:36 a.m. when the E-stop was activated.\nb\nA mass flow meter measured and totalized the liquid nitrogen flow once every 30 minutes.\nc\nBecause nitrogen is not visible, the cloud seen by witnesses was the result of moisture in the air condensing due to the reduced\ntemperature caused by the release.\n32\nInvestigation Report\n4 SAFETY ISSUES\nThe following sections discuss the safety issues contributing to the incident, which include:\n• Single Point of Failure (Section 4.1);\n• Atmospheric Monitoring and Alarm Systems (Section 4.2);\n• Emergency Preparedness (Section 4.3);\n• Process Safety Management System (Section 4.4); and\n• Product Stewardship (Section 4.5).\n33\nInvestigation Report\n4.1 SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE\nProcesses and equipment handling hazardous chemicals should be robust enough such that the failure of a single\ncomponent does not result in a catastrophic incident. Regardless of how the bubbler tube became bent, designing\nthe freezer to avoid this single point of failure could have prevented this incident.\nThe CSB found that the freezer was not designed according to industry good practice guidance, that Linde’s\ndesign-phase process hazards analysis (PHA) did not identify the single-point failure, and that during fabrication\nof FFG’s immersion freezer, Messer did not detect a manufacturing defect—a missing second clamp meant to\nsecure the bubbler tube to the freezer—that exacerbated the bubbler tube’s vulnerability to deformation.\n4.1.1 SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE\nThe design of the immersion freezer involved in the incident was such that the bubbler system used a single\nbubbler tube device to measure liquid level, thus making the bubbler tube a safety-critical device. The bubbler\ntube was the sole input to both the level control loop and the high-level safety interlock, which was configured\nto stop the flow of liquid nitrogen to the immersion freezer in the event that the liquid reached an unsafe level.a\nAs a result, as shown above in Figure 14, when the bubbler tube was bent to the point where the end of the tube\nwas higher than the overflow level for the freezer, the liquid nitrogen level control system was unable to detect\nor modulate the level of liquid in the freezer, and the high-level safety interlock designed to prevent overflow\nfrom the equipment was defeated. The CSB concludes that the immersion freezer was designed such that the\nfailure of a single level measurement device could defeat both the nitrogen level control system and the\nemergency interlock intended to stop nitrogen flow to the freezer. After the bubbler tube was bent, there was\nnothing to prevent the nitrogen release from the freezer.\nIn general, systems should not be designed with single points of failure since, by definition, there would be no\nother redundant or independent safety system available in case of failure. There are several industry guidance\ndocuments that discuss this topic. The Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS) Guidelines for Safe and\nReliable Instrumented Protective Systems explains the decision-making processes for the management of\ninstrumented protective systems throughout a project’s life cycle [12].\nThe “Understanding Failure” section of the guidelines contains a discussion on common cause failure, a term\nused to describe random and systematic events that cause multiple devices, systems, or layers to fail\nsimultaneously [12, p. 322]. According to the CCPS, there are essentially two types of common cause failures:\n1) single points of failure where one malfunctioning device causes an instrumented protective functionb failure,\nand 2) single events that lead to multiple failures in a redundant subsystem [12, p. 323]. Single point of failure\nevents can occur due to systematic failure events that result from human error or random failure events [12, p.\n323]. These random failures are typically managed using redundancy and other means [12, p. 323].\nAdditionally, the International Society of Automation (ISA)c Standard 61511 Functional Safety – Safety\na\nThe high-level safety interlock was responsible for discontinuing the flow of liquid nitrogen to the immersion freezer in the event that\nlevel feedback input exceeded the set deviation limit.\nb\nInstrumented protective function is a safety function designed to achieve a safe state for a specific hazardous event.\nc\nThe ISA is a non-profit professional association of engineers, technicians, and management engaged in industrial automation.\n34\nInvestigation Report\nInstrumented Systems for the Process Industry Sector contains similar guidance regarding single points of\nfailure [13].\nRedundant or independent safety systems, such as additional bubbler tube\nsensors, or another technology to detect the presence of a high liquid KEY LESSON\nlevel independent of the bubbler tube, could have prevented the release of\nliquid nitrogen regardless of the damage to the bubbler tube.\nProcesses and equipment that\nutilize hazardous materials\nThe CSB concludes that Linde did not design the immersion-spiral\nshould be designed robustly\nfreezer in accordance with industry guidance regarding single points of\nenough that the failure of a\nfailure for instrumented systems. Had Linde or Messer included\nsingle component cannot\nadditional independent safeguards to protect against overflow events, this\nresult in a catastrophic\nincident could have been prevented.\nincident.\n4.1.2 LINDE’S DESIGN-PHASE PHA\nPrior to the Messer-Linde acquisition in 2005, Linde performed a PHA on the general immersion-spiral freezer\ndesign. The CCPS defines a PHA as an organized effort to identify and evaluate hazards associated with\nprocesses and operations to enable their control [14]. According to CCPS, a PHA generally involves the use of\nqualitative techniques to identify and assess the significance of hazards, followed by the development of\nconclusions and recommendations to address the hazards. In addition to PHAs conducted on processes that are\nalready installed and operating, a PHA is often conducted during the design phase of a project in an effort to\nidentify potential hazards and the need for additional safeguards prior to fabricating the equipment.\n4.1.2.1 Insufficient Safeguards\nAccording to the completed PHA, potential process deviations for the immersion-spiral freezer identified by the\nPHA team included high flow, high level, and loss of containment, among other deviations. Regarding causes of\nthese deviations,a the PHA lists several potential issues, including failure of the bubbler system, which could\nconsequently result in the release of liquid nitrogen from the immersion freezer. The safeguards identified to\nmitigate the potential “bubbler failure” and other identified causes included a high-level alarm for the immersion\nfreezer, a low temperature alarm/shutdown, the assumed presence of atmospheric monitoring equipment, and\nmaintaining a preventative maintenance schedule on the components (Figure 15).\na\nPotential causes of loss of containment from the immersion freezer and high level in the immersion freezer are linked to the potential\ncauses of high flow in the immersion freezer, which include temperature control system malfunction, I/P failure or miscalibration,\nequipment malfunction – actuated supply/control valve, equipment malfunction – bubbler failure, and improper calibration of the\ncontrol valve.\n35\nInvestigation Report\nFigure 15. Excerpt from Linde PHA showing connection between failure and safeguards. (Credit:\nMesser, annotations by CSB)\nGenerally, a high-level alarm is a logical safeguard to prevent high flow, high level, and/or loss of containment.\nHowever, in the event of the failure mode that occurred in this incident, it was ineffective because the damage to\nthe bubbler tube effectively disabled both the level control loop and the high-level safety alarm. Consequently,\nthe high-level alarm and interlock could not serve as a safeguard, as Linde intended. Further, the only other\nidentified safeguard against bubbler failure was the presence of atmospheric monitoring outside the freezer,\nwhich FFG did not have. Even if FFG did have monitoring and alarm equipment, such systems could not have\nprevented the damage to the bubbler system or liquid nitrogen from overflowing from the freezer; it could only\nhave reduced the severity or consequences of a release.\nThe CSB concludes that Linde did not adequately consider the failure of the liquid nitrogen level control system\nand did not identify appropriate safeguards to mitigate the potential failure. In essence, Linde incorrectly\nidentified the bubbler tube as a safeguard for itself.\n36\nInvestigation Report\n4.1.2.2 PHA Technique\nThe CCPS publication Guidelines for Hazard Evaluation Procedures discusses risk-based determination of the\nadequacy of safeguards identified using scenario-based hazard evaluation [15]. According to these guidelines,\nsafeguards should be analyzed to determine whether they are adequate to mitigate potential failures.\nDetermining the adequacy of safeguards is generally done by analyzing the risk associated with one scenario at\na time. The guidelines state:\nThe common element […] is the development of incident scenarios that are more\nor less detailed time-sequence descriptions of unique initiating cause/loss event\ncombinations, sometimes termed “cause-consequence pairs.” Each initiating\ncause might lead to more than one loss event […]; likewise, a given loss event\n[…] might have various possible initiating causes. However, it is unique\ninitiating cause/loss event combinations that form the scenarios of interest […]\n[15, p. 213].\nGrouped Scenario Causes\nLinde did not evaluate unique cause-consequence scenarios in its design-phase PHA. Instead, Linde grouped\npotential causes of the identified process deviations together. This makes it inherently difficult to determine the\nsequence of events leading from each cause to the consequence. In the absence of a clear sequence of events,\npotential consequences and safeguards identified to protect against the impacts can vary depending on how the\nscenario develops.\nFor example, “Improper calibration of control valve” and “Equipment malfunction – bubbler failure” can both\nresult in excess liquid nitrogen being introduced into the immersion freezer, resulting in an overflow of liquid\nnitrogen. However, the safeguards to protect against each of the causes would be different (Figure 16). In the\ncase of a control valve malfunction, the high-level alarm/safety interlock would likely identify the hazard and\nshut off liquid nitrogen supply to the freezer using separate shutoff valves, as shown in blue in Figure 16.\nYet, in the event of a bent bubbler tube, as was the failure mode in this incident, both the level control device\nand high-level alarm/safety interlock would lose the ability to detect liquid nitrogen level in the immersion\nfreezer (illustrated in Figure 14). Therefore, the high-level alarm/safety interlock would not have been a valid\nsafeguard for the failure of the bubbler panel system or a bent bubbler tube, as shown in red in Figure 16. By\ngrouping potential causes together in this manner, a PHA team can lose sight of which safeguards protect\nagainst which causes.\n37\nInvestigation Report\nFigure 16. Excerpt from Linde PHA showing connection between failure, consequence, and\nsafeguards. (Credit: Messer, annotations by CSB)\nGeneric Scenarios\nThere was also a lack of specificity in the causes identified in the PHA. For instance, the PHA generically listed\n“Equipment malfunction – bubbler failure” as a cause of high flow, high level, and/or loss of containment from\nthe immersion freezer. However, there are several potential failure modes that could cause the bubbler tube to\nfail to provide an accurate measurement to the level control loop and the high-level alarm/safety interlock. For\nexample, there could be incorrect pressure of the gaseous nitrogen being supplied to the bubbler tube, there\ncould be a leak in the fittings, the tubing could be plugged with solids, or the end of the bubbler tube could be\nbent and not fully submerged in the liquid nitrogen, as was the case in this incident. Being specific with cause\ndescriptions would allow the PHA team to fully understand each scenario and analyze which safeguards would\nbe expected to function correctly in a particular scenario, and which could not be relied upon due to a common-\nmode failure.\nThe CSB concludes that Linde did not identify specific incident scenarios or cause-consequence pairs when\nconducting the PHA for the immersion-spiral freezer, which resulted in Linde’s failure to identify adequate\nsafeguards to protect against the overflow of liquid nitrogen from the immersion freezer.\n38\nInvestigation Report\n4.1.3 MANUFACTURING QUALITY CONTROL\nThe immersion freezera involved in this incident was fabricated in early 2016.b Once fabrication of the\nimmersion freezer was complete, the fabrication teamc completed a Quality Control inspection of the equipment\nto ensure that it was fabricated in accordance with design specifications. Following completion of this Quality\nControl inspection, the immersion freezer remained in Messer’s possession until FFG agreed to lease the freezer\nfrom Messer in July 2020. Once FFG committed to leasing the equipment, Messer performed a “functional\ncheckout” of the immersion freezer in August 2020.\nAs discussed in Section 1.2, installation of the Line 4 immersion-spiral freezer began on December 5, 2020, and\nwas complete by December 16, 2020.\nAccording to design specifications, the bubbler tube should have been secured to the interior wall of the\nimmersion freezer with two support clamps (Figure 17). Following the incident, however, the CSB found that\nonly one support clamp had been utilized to secure the bubbler tube to the interior of the immersion freezer\n(Figure 18).\na\nModel no. KFI 38-13\nb\nThe immersion freezer was fabricated for Linde by SWF Industries.\nc\nLinde originally inspected the immersion freezer; Messer later acquired Linde. See Section 1.1.2 for more details on the Linde/Messer\nrelationship.\n39\nInvestigation Report\nFigure 17. Excerpt from piping layout drawing showing the two clamps on the bubbler tube. (Credit:\nMesser, annotations by CSB)\n40\nInvestigation Report\nFigure 18. Photo of bubbler tube secured to immersion freezer tub with one clamp. (Credit: CSB)\nThe missing support clamp was not identified in June 2016 when the initial Quality Control inspection of the\nequipment was completed post-fabrication. The Quality Control Checkout form for the immersion freezer\nincludes a Bubbler Panel and Pan Purge section with several line item verifications related to the equipment.\nOne line item contained in this section directs the user to “check that all support clamps are in place.” The\ncompleted form from June 2016 indicates that this line item was verified at the time of inspection (Figure 19).\nFigure 19. Excerpt from Messer Quality Control checklist indicating that all support\nclamps were in place at the time of June 2016 and August 2020 Quality Control\ninspections. (Credit: Messer, annotations by CSB)\n41\nInvestigation Report\nAfter the incident, the Messer engineer who completed the inspection explained that the only line items related\nto the bubbler tube assembly on the Quality Control Checkout form were bubbler panel and pan purge\ncomponents, all of which were located on the exterior of the immersion freezer. As a result, he did not believe\nthat this line item (the one indicated in Figure 19) included verification of the presence of the two support\nclamps on the bubbler tube inside of the freezer. Additionally, he indicated that the line items on the Quality\nControl Checkout form were meant to be completed in sequential order and that, at this point in the inspection,\nthe lid on the immersion freezer would have been closed.a As a result, it would have been impossible to ensure\nthat the two support clamps on the bubbler tube were in place as part of this line item instruction. The Messer\nengineer indicated that there was no instruction on the Quality Control Checkout form that specifically directed\nhim to verify the presence of the two interior support clamps on the bubbler tube. Additionally, Messer’s\nprocess did not appear to involve cross-checking the freezer as built against the engineering drawings (excerpted\nin Figure 17). Doing so would have presented another opportunity for the quality control inspector to detect the\nmissing clamp. The CSB concludes that Messer’s Quality Control procedures and practices were ineffective in\nensuring that the two support clamps on the bubbler tube were in place at the time of inspection. As a result,\nMesser failed to identify the missing support clamp during Quality Control inspection.b\nFollowing this incident, Messer examined another immersion freezer that was fabricated at the same time as the\nfreezer involved in this incident. Inspection of this freezer revealed that, similar to the freezer involved in the\nincident, the bubbler tube was secured to the interior of the freezer by a single support clamp. The bubbler tube\nwas also found to be bent, though to a lesser degree than the bubbler tube in the freezer at FFG.\nMesser later completed a survey of 14 additional immersion freezers to determine whether the bubbler tubes in\nany of these freezers were either bent or damaged, or secured using a single clamp configuration. As a result of\nthis survey, Messer discovered two additional damaged bubbler tubes, both of which were secured by two\nsupport clamps, as designed. No other single support clamp configurations were identified.\nWhile any length of unsecured tubing is susceptible to physical damage and movement, the combination of\nunsecured tubing length and support clamp location directly affects to what degree the tubing can be bent.\nConsequently, the CSB concludes that the combination of unsecured tubing length and support clamp location\nworsened the potential for the bubbler tube to become bent, which ultimately resulted in the bubbler system\nbecoming non-functional.c\n4.1.4 MESSER POST-INCIDENT ACTIONS\nFollowing the incident, Messer implemented several changes to its existing immersion freezer design. The\nchanges are intended to provide additional layers of protection against the possibility of an overflow of liquid\nnitrogen. Among the additional layers of protection are 1) a dual bubbler panel system with two independent\nbubbler tubes, constructed of schedule 80 piping to provide increased resistance to displacement, 2) an external\nresistance temperature detector (RTD) located on the horizontal portion of the freezer inlet, intended to detect\na\nThe lid is not raised until two sections later in the QC procedure in the “Hydraulic Power Unit” section.\nb\nAfter the incident, Messer revised its Quality Control process and procedures to require verification of the presence of the bubbler tube\nclamps and reordered the sequence of inspection steps to facilitate this verification. Consequently, the CSB makes no recommendation\nto Messer regarding its Quality Control process.\nc\nAfter the incident Messer revised its freezer design such that it now includes multiple layers of protection against liquid nitrogen\noverflow. Consequently, as noted below, the CSB makes no recommendation to Messer regarding the design of its immersion freezers.\n42\nInvestigation Report\nthe presence of cryogenic liquid and activate safety interlocks, 3) changes to the programmable logic controller\nto accommodate for the additional bubbler panel and RTD, and 4) vaporization of liquid nitrogen to gaseous\nnitrogen for use in the bubbler systems at the bulk storage tanks rather than at the freezer equipment.\nBecause Messer’s freezer design now includes multiple layers of protection against liquid nitrogen overflow, the\nCSB makes no recommendation to Messer regarding the design of its immersion freezers.\nMesser has also revised its Quality Control process and procedures to require verification of the presence of the\nbubbler tube clamps and re-ordered the sequence of inspection steps to facilitate this verification. Therefore, the\nCSB makes no recommendation to Messer regarding its Quality Control process.\n4.2 ATMOSPHERIC MONITORING AND ALARM SYSTEMS\nAtmospheric monitoring and alarm systems provide important mitigative protection against hazards in the\natmosphere when preventive measures fail to contain the hazardous materials inside a process. Fixed\natmospheric monitoring and alarm systems are essential for preventing people from entering unsafe\nenvironments, such as areas affected by uncontrolled liquid nitrogen releases. To effectively implement these\nsafety-critical systems, it is necessary to assess application-specific and site-specific conditions.\nLiquid nitrogen rapidly expands when it evaporates, and in a poorly ventilated area, nitrogen gas can quickly\ndisplace oxygen, creating an oxygen-deficient atmosphere (Section 1.6.1). When people breathe in air that does\nnot have enough oxygen, immediate effects, including unconsciousness after only one or two breaths, and\nultimately death, can occur (Section 1.6.2). The exposed person has no warning and cannot sense that the\noxygen level is too low [8, p. 2]. Therefore, active monitoring of the oxygen concentration in areas where\noxygen deficiency may occur, with an associated audible and visual alarm to alert people to the hazard, is a\ncommon and effective strategy to prevent worker exposure to hazardous atmospheres [16, p. 68].\n4.2.1 ATMOSPHERIC MONITORING AND ALARMS AT FFG\nAbsence of monitoring and alarms on Line 2\nFFG had operated a liquid nitrogen spiral freezer on Line 2 beginning in May 2020 (Section 1.2). FFG and\nMesser divided their responsibilities according to the chart shown in Figure 5 (Section 1.5). The task\nresponsibility chart did not specifically mention atmospheric monitoring.\nDuring the Line 2 freezer installation, Messer conducted several training and product stewardship activities with\nmaintenance technicians and the packaging supervisor using a checklist titled the “Food Projects Checklist.”a\nThe checklist included specific items that each referenced atmospheric monitoring in some way, including:\na\nThis checklist documented Messer’s customer stewardship practices by providing customer interface with the necessary training and\ndocumentation on the equipment and liquid nitrogen.\n43\nInvestigation Report\n• transmitting the Safety Data Sheet (SDS)a for liquid nitrogen to FFG. The SDS mentioned the use of\natmospheric monitoring as a safety precaution;\n• discussing the availability of additional resources for safe handling, such as guidance from the\nCompressed Gas Association (CGA), the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), and OSHA,\neach of which, to varying extents, mention the need for atmospheric monitoring;\n• submitting Line 2 freezer operation and maintenance manuals to FFG (which mentioned the use of\natmospheric monitoring); and,\n• a line item directing Messer to discuss atmospheric monitoring with FFG. The checklist box for\natmospheric monitoring did not indicate a “Yes” for verification like the others for completion but\ninstead was blank.\nThis checklist was completed and signed by FFG and Messer on May 19, 2020.\nMesser recommended, via its SDS, that its liquid nitrogen customers implement oxygen detection systems at\ntheir facilities. The SDS stated that “oxygen detectors should be used when asphyxiating gases may be released”\nas an appropriate engineering control.\nThe Line 2 spiral freezer PHA,b conducted by a Messer predecessor, identified that a loss of containment of\nliquid nitrogen could result in oxygen deficiency and personal injury. Among other safeguards, the PHA listed\nthe use of atmospheric monitors as a recommended safeguard. This PHA was not shared with FFG and was not\nspecific to FFG’s process and facility, but it shows that Messer had institutional knowledge about the need for\natmospheric monitoring.\nDespite the actions discussed above, FFG did not install atmospheric monitoring and alarm equipment on the\nLine 2 liquid nitrogen spiral freezer.\nIn August 2020, after visiting the FFG plant, a Messer employee emailed the FFG Senior Vice President of\nOperations to express concern and to highlight the absence of atmospheric monitoring equipment at an area of\nthe plant adjacent to Line 2. The email stated:\nWe highly recommend the use of permanently mounted Oxygen […] monitors\naugmented with the use of personal/portable monitors as part of the plant’s safety\nsystem.\nI have attached a gas monitor letter with recommended manufacturers of\nmonitors.\nFFG did not respond to the email.\na\nThe Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200(g)), revised in 2012, requires that the chemical manufacturer, distributor, or\nimporter SDSs (formerly MSDSs or Material Safety Data Sheets) for each hazardous chemical to downstream users to communicate\ninformation on these hazards. The SDS includes information such as the properties of each chemical; the physical, health, and\nenvironmental health hazards; protective measures; and safety precautions for handling, storing, and transporting the chemical.\nb\nThe PHA was conducted in 2004 by BOC, which was eventually acquired by Linde and subsequently Messer.\n44\nInvestigation Report\nAbsence of monitoring and alarms on Line 4\nWhen FFG installed the Line 4 immersion-spiral freezer, Messer and FFG documented the same task\nresponsibility chart for Line 4 as they did for Line 2. As with Line 2, the chart included no specific mention of\natmospheric monitoring, though several of the tasks included information that mentioned the need. After the\nincident, FFG management told the CSB that they were unaware of the need for atmospheric monitoring.\nConversely, Messer told the CSB, that “it was communicated to them [FFG] that they needed to have an\n[oxygen] monitor.” Ultimately, neither FFG nor Messer installed atmospheric monitoring and alarm equipment\nin the Line 4 freezer room or on the freezer equipment.\nMesser believed that at the time, it had no legal or contractual obligation to install atmospheric monitoring and\nalarm systems at FFG; nor did contemporary guidance from the CGA, further discussed below in Section\n4.2.2.3, require the use of such systems at FFG (although they were recommended). Contractual or legal\nobligations aside, in terms of safety, whether it was FFG’s or Messer’s responsibility to install atmospheric\nmonitoring and alarm systems is irrelevant; both companies could have and should have taken action to\nmaximize the safety of the FFG Line 4 freezer operation.\nIn summary, the CSB concludes that Messer informed FFG of the need for atmospheric monitoring of its liquid\nnitrogen processes on at least three occasions. Despite Messer’s recommendations, neither FFG nor Messer took\naction to install monitoring or alarm equipment on the Line 4 process, which could have alerted workers to the\npresence of an oxygen-deficient atmosphere, and, if designed accordingly, could have triggered an emergency\nshutdown of the liquid nitrogen systems.\nAs discussed in Section 1.1.1, Gold Creek currently owns and operates the former FFG facility. As of this\nreport’s publication, there are currently no liquid nitrogen freezing processes at the former FFG Plant 4 building\nwhich Gold Creek now operates. Therefore, the CSB does not issue a recommendation to Gold Creek related to\natmospheric monitoring or ventilation of liquid nitrogen processes.\n4.2.2 EXISTING INDUSTRY GUIDANCE FOR ATMOSPHERIC MONITORING\nAND ALARM SYSTEMS\nThe risk of oxygen-deficient atmospheres is well understood, and there is a wealth of guidance available,\ndiscussed below, that if followed, could have helped reduce the severity of this incident.\n4.2.2.1 CSB Guidance\nIn June 2003, the CSB published a Nitrogen Asphyxiation Safety Bulletin.a The bulletin states [8, pp. 6-8]:\nThe atmosphere in a small, enclosed area may be unfit for breathing prior to\nentry, or it may change over time, depending on the type of equipment or work\nbeing performed. Recognizing this hazard, good practice calls for continuous\nmonitoring of an enclosed area to detect oxygen-deficient atmospheres.\na\nThis CSB product, along with a safety video on the same topic, can be located here: Hazards of Nitrogen Asphyxiation | CSB\n45\nInvestigation Report\n[…]\nWarning and protection devices, if properly installed and maintained, warn\nworkers of hazardous atmospheres.\nThe safe handling of nitrogen, described above, is effective only if personnel are\ntrained on the importance of atmospheric monitoring equipment—both how to\nuse it and how to determine when it is not working properly. Personnel should\nbe trained on how to properly respond and evacuate in the event of failure of the\nsystem.\n4.2.2.2 CCPS Guidance\nThe CCPS book Continuous Monitoring for Hazardous Material Releases provides guidance on the use of\nindoor atmospheric monitoring [17, pp. 63-64]:\nThere are occasions when process equipment must be located indoors due to\nweather-related or quality control issues. Combustible [and oxygen]a gas\ndetection should be provided in these buildings […]. This detection should be\nconfigured to:\n• Send an alarm signal to a continuously manned location\n• Activate visible and audible alarm devices on the exterior of the\nbuilding at each entranceway and within the structure. The devices\nwithin the structure should be configured using the guidance for fire\nalarm devices, as provided in NFPA 72, National Fire Alarm and\nSignaling Code\nIn some cases, it may also be advantageous for the detection system to initiate an\nautomatic shutdown and/or isolation of the potential release sources within the\nstructure. […] In many cases, remote-operated shutdown and isolation systems\nand/or remotely located isolation means will suffice.b\n4.2.2.3 Compressed Gas Association Guidance\nThe CGA has numerous guidelines and publications that address many aspects of the safe handling of industrial\ngases, including the safe handling of cryogenic liquids, storage of compressed gases in containers, and oxygen-\ndeficient atmospheres.\na\nAlthough this excerpt concerns atmospheric monitoring for combustible gases, the guidance is equally applicable to toxic gases or to\noxygen-deficiency hazards.\nb\nThe ISA Technical Report ISA-TR84.00.07, Guidance on the Evaluation of Fire, Combustible Gas, and Toxic Gas System Effectiveness\n[55] offers actionable guidance on the design and implementation of atmospheric monitoring and automated emergency shutdown\nsystems.\n46\nInvestigation Report\nCGA P-12 Guideline for Safe Handling of Cryogenic and Refrigerated Liquids\nCGA P-12 is intended to provide “general information about the properties, transportation, storage, safe\nhandling, and safe use of the cryogenic and refrigerated liquids commonly used by industry and institutions. It is\nintended for cryogenic and refrigerated liquid users, shippers, carriers, distributors, equipment designers or\ninstallers, safety administrators, and anyone seeking an introduction to cryogenic and refrigerated liquids [18, p.\n1].”\nAt the time of the incident, the standard stated:\nIf low oxygen atmospheres are possible, installation of analyzers equipped with\nalarms should be used to monitor the oxygen content. Whenever personnel enter\nenclosed areas, the breathing atmosphere shall be constantly monitored by\nappropriate instrumentation [5, p. 17] (emphasis added).\nIn January 2023, CGA issued the seventh edition of CGA P-12, which updated the following language\nconcerning oxygen monitoring from “should be” to “shall be” [18, pp. 8, 11]:a\nAreas where an oxygen-deficient atmosphere can occur shall be monitored by\nan area monitoring system, [personal atmospheric monitoring systems],b or a\ncombination of the two as determined by a hazard assessment [18, p. 8]\n(emphasis added).\nIf low oxygen atmospheres are possible as determined by a hazard assessment,\ninstallation of analyzers equipped with alarms shall be used to monitor the\noxygen content. Whenever personnel enter enclosed areas, the breathing\natmosphere shall be constantly monitored by appropriate instrumentation [18, p.\n11] (emphasis added).\nCGA P-18 Standard for Bulk Inert Gas Systems\nAccording to the CGA:\nThis standard contains minimum requirements for locating/siting, selecting\nequipment, installing, starting up, maintaining, and removing bulk inert gas\nsupply systems [19, p. 1].\nThe CGA defines the boundary of a bulk inert supply system:\nThe bulk inert supply system terminates at the source valve, where the gas or\nliquid supply first enters the supply line [19, p. 1].\na\nThe change in this guideline from “should be” to “shall be” was made after the FFG incident in 2021.\nb\nPersonal atmospheric monitoring systems are typically body-mounted or hand-held atmospheric monitoring equipment, as opposed to\nfixed or permanently mounted atmospheric monitors.\n47\nInvestigation Report\nThe standard states:\nIndoor areas where bulk inert gas systems are installed shall be continuously\nmonitored with an atmosphere monitoring system. The system shall provide an\naudible and visual alarm when the oxygen level drops to 19.5%. The alarm shall\nbe located inside the area and immediately outside of all entrances to the indoor\narea. The atmosphere monitoring system also shall send a signal to a central\nmonitoring station or a continuously occupied location if one is provided on-site.\nDesign of the monitoring system shall allow for routine testing to demonstrate\nfunctionality [19, p. 17] (emphasis added).\nIt should be noted that this requirement applies to bulk storage systems that are installed indoors, and not to\napplication equipment such as FFG’s immersion freezer, or to bulk storage systems installed outdoors, as was\nthe case at FFG. However, CGA P-18 is among the many pieces of guidance issued by the CGA highlighting the\nimportance of using atmospheric monitoring when the potential for an oxygen-deficient atmosphere exists.\nCGA P-76 Hazards of Oxygen-Deficient Atmospheres\nRelevant guidance from CGA P-76 includes:\nIn processes where cryogenic liquids are handled and vaporization takes place,\ncare shall be taken to avoid situations where personnel are exposed to oxygen\ndeficiency [6, p. 5].\nThe standard contains a list of examples of such spaces, and among the various examples, rooms containing\nliquid nitrogen food freezers are explicitly identified [6, p. 5].\nThere are a number of situations where the need for ventilation or atmospheric\nmonitoring shall be assessed in order to avoid asphyxiation incidents from inert\ngases and/or oxygen depletion.\nThe occurrence of an oxygen-deficient atmosphere within an area depends upon\nthe ventilation of the area, the volume of the space, and how much gas flow (flow\nrate or quantity) could be released. From this consideration, a risk assessment\nshall be carried out and suitable control measure implemented to reach the\nexpected level of safety [6, p. 7].\nConsideration should also be given to the use of workplace atmospheric\nmonitoring, for example, wearing a personal oxygen analyzer or installing an\nanalyzer in the work area. The location of the monitor shall be based on an\nassessment […] [6, p. 8] (emphasis added).\n48\nInvestigation Report\n4.2.2.4 International Code Council Guidance\nThe International Code Council (ICC) [20] authors the International Fire Code (IFC). The IFC contains\nguidance for both compressed gases and cryogenic liquids, including those that are not flammable or\ncombustible. With regard to atmospheric monitoring for compressed gases, the IFC states:\nGas detection system. In rooms or areas not provided with ventilation […], a\ngas detection system [or] an oxygen depletion alarm system, either of which\ninitiates audible and visible alarm signals in the room or area where sensors are\ninstalled, shall be provided [21, pp. 53-7].a\nThis guidance did not apply to FFG’s liquid nitrogen system because the IFC only applies it to compressed\ngases. Regarding the use of atmospheric monitoring for cryogenic liquids, the standard states:\nInert cryogenic fluids, including argon, helium and nitrogen, shall comply with\nANSI/CGA P-18 [21, pp. 55-1].b\n4.2.2.5 NFPA Guidance\nConcerning the use of cryogenic fluids, NFPA 55, Compressed Gases and Cryogenic Fluids Code states:\nStorage, use, and handling of inert cryogenic fluids shall be in accordance with\nANSI/CGA P-18, Standard for Bulk Inert Gas Systems at Consumer Sites [22,\npp. 55-35].c\nNFPA 55 contains guidance on the use of atmospheric monitoring for corrosive gases,d toxic and highly toxic\ngases,e hydrogen,f carbon dioxide,g ethylene oxide,h and acetylene,i but not for cryogenic asphyxiants such as\nliquid nitrogen.\n4.2.2.6 Lack of Adherence to Industry Guidance\nDespite industry guidance, FFG did not equip the Line 4 freezer room with an atmospheric monitoring system\nthat would continuously monitor for a breathable atmosphere and notify personnel by alarms to evacuate the\narea if unsafe. Not implementing such a system resulted in at least 14 employees entering or approaching the\noxygen-deficient atmosphere on the day of the incident. FFG workers were not trained on the hazards of\noxygen-deficient atmospheres (Section 4.4.1.5). Without atmospheric monitoring and alarms, site personnel\na\nIFC § 5307.2.1 (2021 ed.)\nb\nIFC § 5501.1 (2021 ed.)\nc\nNFPA 55 § 8.1.2 (2020 ed.)\nd\nNFPA 55 § 7.5 (2020 ed.)\ne\nNFPA 55 § 7.9 (2020 ed.)\nf\nNFPA 55 § 10 (2020 ed.)\ng\nNFPA 55 § 13 (2020 ed.)\nh\nNFPA 55 § 14 (2020 ed.)\ni\nNFPA 55 § 15 (2020 ed.)\n49\nInvestigation Report\nwere likely unaware of the hazard around them when the freezer\noverflowed.

However, this guidance could be strengthened to prevent\nfuture incidents involving cryogenic asphyxiants.\nNeed for Harmonization of CGA Standards\nAs noted earlier, both CGA P-12 and CGA P-18 guidelines require atmospheric monitoring in areas where an\noxygen-deficient atmosphere can occur. However, CGA P-76 describes the use of such systems as a\nconsideration rather than a requirement.\nThe CSB recommends that the CGA update CGA P-76 to require that atmospheric monitoring systems shall be\nutilized with processes, equipment, and piping systems capable of producing oxygen-deficient atmospheres, and\nto require that atmospheric monitoring systems provide both visible and audible alarm indication distinct from\nthe building’s fire alarm system at a continuously attended location.\nGap in ICC and NFPA Cryogenic Fluids Guidance\nThe IFC and NFPA 55 both contain guidance for using and handling compressed gases and cryogenic fluids. In\nboth standards, the guidance for the use of compressed gases is extensive, and for the use of atmospheric\nmonitoring for compressed gases, both standards’ guidance is typically either prescriptive or required as an\nalternative to adequate ventilation, depending on the characteristics of the compressed gas and the application.\nThis guidance could have reduced the severity of this incident had it applied to cryogenic asphyxiants like liquid\nnitrogen and been applied at FFG. Instead, for the use of atmospheric monitoring with liquid nitrogen, both\nstandards simply refer to CGA P-18 Standard for Bulk Inert Gas Systems and otherwise contain no specific\nguidance regarding atmospheric monitoring for liquid nitrogen.\nCGA P-18 only covers the bulk storage of inert gases and cryogenic liquids, not the end use of equipment such\nas the FFG Line 4 immersion-spiral freezer, and therefore the standard did not apply to the FFG immersion\n50\nInvestigation Report\nfreezer or the room in which it was located. There is thus a gap in NFPA’s and ICC’s coverage of atmospheric\nmonitoring for cryogenic asphyxiants including liquid nitrogen. The NFPA and the ICC should close this gap.\nThe CSB recommends that the ICC update the International Fire Code to require the use of atmospheric\nmonitoring with cryogenic asphyxiants in accordance with industry guidance such as is contained in CGA P-76\nHazards of Oxygen-Deficient Atmospheres and CGA P-12 Safe Handling of Cryogenic Liquids in addition to\nCGA P-18 Standard for Bulk Inert Gas Systems.\nThe CSB recommends that NFPA update its Compressed Gases and Cryogenic Fluids Code to require the use\nof atmospheric monitoring with cryogenic asphyxiants in accordance with industry guidance such as is\ncontained in CGA P-76 Hazards of Oxygen-Deficient Atmospheres and CGA P-12 Safe Handling of Cryogenic\nLiquids in addition to CGA P-18 Standard for Bulk Inert Gas Systems.\nNeed for a Comprehensive Liquid Nitrogen Standard\nThe CGA has established guidelines for the safe production, storage, transportation, handling, and use of\ngaseous, liquid, and solid carbon dioxide, an asphyxiant with hazards similar to liquid nitrogen. CGA G-6.5,\nStandard for Small Stationary Insulated Carbon Dioxide Systems,a serves as a comprehensive standard for\ncarbon dioxide application systems [23, p. 1].b CGA G-6.5 discusses the implementation of key asphyxiation\nhazard safeguards, including:\n• the location and required maintenance of atmospheric monitors [23, pp. 7-8, 10];\n• requirements for visual and audible alarms in response to an oxygen-deficient atmosphere [23, p. 9];\n• design, function, and location of room ventilation systems [23, p. 6];\n• PPE requirements for entering an oxygen-deficient atmosphere caused by the presence of carbon\ndioxide [23, p. 6];\n• hazards introduced by installing carbon dioxide systems in enclosed, recessed, and unventilated spaces\n[23, p. 8]; and,\n• Entry restrictions to areas with potential for oxygen-deficient atmospheres [23, p. 15].\nDespite the general guidance from CGA mentioned elsewhere in this report, no equivalent comprehensive\nstandard exists specifically for liquid nitrogen application systems. CGA G-6.5 presents several critical\nsafeguards equally applicable for both carbon dioxide and liquid nitrogen systems with asphyxiation risks, as\ndiscussed below.\na\nThe CSB chose CGA G-6.5, Standard for Small Stationary Insulated Carbon Dioxide Systems as an example comprehensive standard\ndue to the similar natures of cryogenic liquid carbon dioxide and nitrogen, and their similar use in the food industry. Specifically, the\nsmall stationary standard for carbon dioxide systems addresses operations like those facilities with nitrogen systems at chicken\nprocessing facilities—as opposed to a similar standard for large systems, CGA G-6.1 Standard for Large Insulated Liquid Carbon\nDioxide Systems at User Sites.\nb\nThe IFC also provides comparable guidance for carbon dioxide systems in Section 5307.3 Insulated liquid carbon dioxide systems used\nin beverage dispensing applications.\n51\nInvestigation Report\nRegarding the requirement for alarmed atmospheric monitoring, CGA G-6.5 states:\nA carbon dioxide detector with an appropriate alarm system shall be installed\nwhere dangerous concentrations of carbon dioxide can accumulate […] [23, p.\n6] (emphasis added);\nA carbon dioxide monitoring system with appropriate visual and/or audible alarm\nshall be installed to detect dangerous concentrations of carbon dioxide [23, p. 9]\n(emphasis added);\nThe carbon dioxide leak detection system when activated shall sound an audible\nalarm within the room or area in which the system is installed. Gas detection\nsystems shall be installed and maintained in accordance with the\nmanufacturer’s instructions [23, p. 10] (emphasis added); and\nInstalled carbon dioxide monitors should be checked according to the carbon\ndioxide monitor manufacturer’s guidelines for proper operation and inspection\nfrequency […]. Ensure placement of carbon dioxide monitors and warning signs\nmeet the [local] requirements [23, p. 15].\nWith regard to locating cryogenic asphyxiant equipment in enclosed areas and the critical need for properly\ninstalled ventilation, CGA G-6.5 states:\nEnclosed, improperly ventilated areas can include […] outside locations such as\none with four solid walls open to the atmosphere. Even if there is no roof or\nceiling this is still considered an enclosed space because the carbon dioxide will\nnot disperse as it is heavier than air [23, p. 7];\nVentilation systems shall exhaust from the lowest level with the make-up air\nentering at a higher point.a Make up and exhaust rate of flow shall meet code\nrequirements [23, p. 6];\nStandard commercial HVAC systems or additional fans typically do not provide\nsufficient protection […] for carbon dioxide ventilation [23, p. 6]; and\n[O]penings […] shall be spaced to create cross ventilation and located as low as\npossible to ensure that carbon dioxide will not pool and cause exposure to\noccupants. Any installation that does not meet these criteria should be considered\nan enclosed installation [23, p. 8].\nThe CSB concludes that industry guidance for carbon dioxide is extensive. Comparable, specific guidance for\nliquid nitrogen could help prevent future incidents similar to the one at FFG.\na\nCarbon dioxide is heavier than air and accumulates at low points, similar to cold, vaporized liquid nitrogen.\n52\nInvestigation Report\nConsequently, the CSB recommends that the CGA develop a comprehensive standard for the safe storage,\nhandling, and use of liquid nitrogen in stationary applications, comparable to the guidance presented in CGA G-\n6.5 Standard for Small Stationary Insulated Carbon Dioxide Systems. At a minimum, the standard should\ninclude:\na) requirements for and guidance on the location, the maintenance, and the functional testing of\natmospheric monitoring devices;\nb) requirements for visual and audible alarms distinct from the building’s fire alarm system and at a\ncontinuously attended location; and,\nc) guidance on the sizing, design, function, periodic maintenance and testing, and location of room and\nemergency ventilation systems.\n53\nInvestigation Report\n4.3 EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS\nEffective emergency preparedness can reduce the consequences of a catastrophic incident. FFG had no\nemergency action plan (EAP) for a liquid nitrogen release, did not train its employees on how to recognize or\nrespond to such a release, and did not equip them to safely respond.\n4.3.1 REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\nEPCRA\nThe Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which is a portion of the Superfund\nAmendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), establishes many requirements for community emergency\npreparedness [24]. Because FFG utilized more than 10,000 pounds of liquid nitrogen, Sections 311-312 of\nEPCRA required FFG to submit certain information to local emergency response organizations.\nUnder EPCRA, FFG was required to 1) submit an SDS for liquid nitrogen to local response organizations, and\n2) submit an annual report to those organizations detailing, among other requirements, that FFG utilized liquid\nnitrogen, its inventory of liquid nitrogen, and where and how at its facility liquid nitrogen was utilized.\nOSHA HAZWOPER\nOSHA’s Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) regulation (found at 29 CFR\n1910.120) requires under § 1910.120(q)(1) that employers develop an emergency response plan (ERP). Under §\n1910.120(q)(2), the regulation requires, among other things, that ERPs contain provisions for:\n• pre-planning and coordination with outside response organizations;\n• emergency recognition and prevention;\n• emergency alerting and response procedures;\n• employee training such that only trained employees respond to an emergency; and,\n• PPE and emergency equipment.\nThe applicability of the HAZWOPER standard is not limited to substances covered under OSHA’s PSM\nstandard. OSHA, on its website,a has a flowchart for use in determining whether an incident requires emergency\nresponse. According to the flowchart, an incident involving liquid nitrogen, which can create an oxygen-\ndeficient atmosphere, requires either emergency response under HAZWOPER or evacuation under 29 CFR\n1910.38.\na\nhttps://www.osha.gov/emergency-preparedness/hazardous-waste-operations/background\n54\nInvestigation Report\n4.3.2 INEFFECTIVE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS\nFFG Emergency Action Plan\nFFG’s EAP consisted of a 46-page slideshow presentation written in English.a The EAP contained the following\nmaterial:\n• Evacuation routes and rally points specific to each building at the facility\n• General exit route safety requirements, such as the requirement for an adequate number of available\nroutes, that routes have adequate signage, and that routes be kept clear of obstacles that might hinder use\n• Shelter-in-place locations\n• Safety shower and eyewash station locations\n• The requirement that “designated personnel will perform rescue […] medical and first aid duties”\n• Incident reporting requirements\nFFG’s EAP did not mention liquid nitrogen. Other than general evacuation and shelter-in-place directions, the\nplan contained no guidance to employees on how, whether, or when to respond to an emergency, or what\nconstituted an emergency. The plan did call for “designated personnel” to perform rescue and first aid duties,\nbut in a response to a CSB information request, FFG wrote that:\nFFG has no employees trained or qualified to perform rescue duties nor first aid\nduties. When the need arises we would call 911 for assistance from the [fire\ndepartment].\nThe CSB found no evidence that FFG had any formalized policies or procedures for responding to a liquid\nnitrogen release. The CSB concludes that although FFG had a written emergency action plan, it was severely\ninadequate to address a liquid nitrogen emergency. Its inadequacies included 1) that it was not written in\nSpanish, the primary language of many of FFG’s workers; 2) that it made no mention of the existence of liquid\nnitrogen at the facility; 3) that it made no mention of the hazards of liquid nitrogen; 4) that it had no instructions\nfor how, whether, or when to respond to a release of liquid nitrogen other than general evacuation instructions;\n5) that it contained no information or plan for how employees were to be notified of an emergency; 6) that it\ncontained no information on what constituted an emergency or what types of emergencies to which employees\nmight need to respond; and 7) that it had no provision for proactively interacting with local emergency\nresponders despite the company’s stated practice of relying on them for emergency response.\nLack of Warning and Poor Emergency Communication\nAs discussed above, FFG had no atmospheric monitoring systems or alarms to alert employees to a release of\nliquid nitrogen or the presence of an oxygen-deficient atmosphere (Section 4.2.1). The result was that many of\na\nThe overwhelming majority of the FFG Plant 4 workforce, including five of the six fatally injured workers, were either non-English\nspeaking or spoke English as a non-primary language.\n55\nInvestigation Report\nthe employees responding to the incident or evacuating the facility had no idea what the emergency was; only\nthat some of their coworkers were missing. Further, news of the emergency and the order to evacuate was only\nspread by word of mouth, rather than by a plant-wide alarm or notification system, which did not exist at the\nfacility (other than the building’s fire alarm). The CSB concludes that as a result of FFG’s poor emergency\ncommunication, employees attempting to respond to the incident or evacuate the building were only minimally\ninformed, if at all, of the nature and severity of the emergency.\nDelay in Emergency Notification\nThere was a delay in notification to the fire department. FFG began the building evacuation at roughly 9:55\na.m., but the first call to 911 was not until 10:11 a.m. (Section 2.2.2).\nOne of the fatally injured workers was still alive when she was retrieved by firefighters but died shortly\nthereafter in the hospital emergency department. Table 2 below summarizes the response timeline with respect\nto this fatally injured worker. Prompt notification to emergency responders is critical in emergencies and might\nhave prevented the death of this worker.\nTable 2. Incident timeline focusing on worker who died at the hospital.\nTime Event\n9:55 a.m. (approx.) FFG begins evacuation of Plant 4\nBetween 9:55-10:10 a.m. Worker enters Line 4 freezer room and becomes unconscious\n(estimated)\n10:11 a.m. First FFG call to 911\n10:21 a.m. (approx.)

Worker retrieved from FFG Plant 4\n10:46 a.m. Worker delivered alive, but in critical condition, to emergency department\n11:00 a.m. Worker pronounced dead\nUnprepared Workforce\nFFG employees at all levels of the organization were unaware of either the existence of liquid nitrogen at the\nfacility, the hazards of liquid nitrogen, or both (Table 3, Section 4.4.1.5). In addition to this widespread lack of\nawareness of the presence and hazards of liquid nitrogen, multiple employees told the CSB that the company did\nnot conduct any drills for a liquid nitrogen release or fire.\nFour additional employees perished (including the employee who died at the hospital) and three were seriously\ninjured during the response to the liquid nitrogen release and the evacuation. None of these employees normally\n56\nInvestigation Report\nworked in the Line 4 freezer room, and their normal evacuation routes from the facility would not have taken\nthem through the freezer room. The CSB concludes that the four workers who subsequently were fatally injured\nwere attempting some sort of response to the release. The CSB found no evidence that FFG trained its\nemployees not to respond to emergencies. In addition to not mentioning liquid nitrogen or its hazards, FFG’s\nEAP slideshow, shown to employees upon initial hiring, did not direct employees not to respond and instead\nsimply contained instructions on how to evacuate the building. In post-incident statements provided to OSHA, a\nfew workers (fewer than 10) told OSHA that they had watched a video or had been told by supervisors in the\npast to evacuate the building during an emergency, but none of them mentioned liquid nitrogen in those\nstatements, and most of the workers’ statements focused on fire or weather emergencies.\nSeveral FFG employeesa who were exposed to the oxygen-deficient atmosphere but survived the incident told\nthe CSB that they were directly investigating or otherwise responding to the incident when they were injured or\nnearly injured, despite lacking any training or equipmentb to safely do so. One of them lost consciousness and\nwas rescued by other responding employees; he spent two days recovering in the hospital. Another reported\nbending down to attempt to rescue another employee (the worker discussed above in Table 2), feeling dizzy and\ndisoriented, and nearly fainting before escaping under his own power.c Multiple other employees who reported\nresponding to the incident were not injured or sustained minor injuries. However, any of them could easily have\nbeen seriously or fatally injured. In total, at least 14 employees (roughly 10% of the workforce at the facility)\nresponded to the liquid nitrogen release: four of them were fatally injured,d three were seriously injured, and at\nleast seven were uninjured or sustained minor injuries.\nThe CSB concludes that FFG did not prepare its workforce in any meaningful way to respond to a release of\nliquid nitrogen. The company’s deficiencies included 1) its lack of emergency response training for its\nworkforce, 2) its lack of employee training on how to identify a liquid nitrogen release, 3) the lack of automated\nmeans to detect and inform its workers of a liquid nitrogen release, and 4) insufficient direction to its employees\nnot to respond or attempt rescue during a liquid nitrogen release.\nAs a result of FFG’s unpreparedness, the severity of the incident was greatly increased during evacuation and\nresponse activities when four additional employees were fatally injured, three employees were seriously injured,\nand at least seven others sustained minor injuries or were uninjured but easily could have been seriously or\nfatally injured. Had FFG effectively prepared its workforce for a liquid nitrogen release, the four additional\nfatalities and three of the four serious injuries could have been prevented.e\na\nThe CSB is aware of at least seven employees who responded in some way but were either uninjured or not seriously injured.\nb\nFFG had no equipment or PPE that would have enabled workers to enter an oxygen-deficient atmosphere, such as supplied air systems\nor SCBA.\nc\nThis employee (the Plant 4 Maintenance Manager) very nearly asphyxiated during his attempted response. However, because he was\nnot admitted to the hospital, his injuries were not considered “serious” according to the CSB’s injury reporting requirements. Although\nhe is not counted among the four serious injuries (three employees and a firefighter) that resulted from this incident, this employee\ncould have easily died.\nd\nThese are in addition to the two maintenance workers who died initially.\ne\nThe fourth serious injury was suffered by a firefighter responding to the incident, and this injury likely would have occurred regardless\nof any action taken by FFG other than preventing the release altogether.\n57\nInvestigation Report\n4.3.3 POST-INCIDENT ACTIONS – EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS\nThe CSB requested information from Gold Creek pertaining to its emergency preparedness policies and\nprocedures. Gold Creek submitted a policy document titled Emergency Action Program and several emergency\nprocedures. The emergency procedures offer checklist-style instructions for Gold Creek’s facilities in the event\nof fire, tornado, ammonia release, liquid nitrogen release, earthquake, and other emergencies. Each of the\nemergency procedures is written in both English and Spanish.\nThe CSB concludes that Gold Creek’s policy documents and emergency procedures are more robust than FFG’s\nemergency action plan was at the time of the incident and could have reduced the severity of this incident had\nFFG implemented similar policies and procedures. Consequently, the CSB makes no recommendations to Gold\nCreek pertaining to the development of emergency preparedness policies or procedures. However, policies and\nprocedures must be effectively implemented and communicated in relevant languages. Gold Creek’s EAP\nincludes provisions for training at initial hiring, with annual refresher trainings at minimum. Therefore, the CSB\nmakes no recommendation to Gold Creek pertaining to employee training for its EAP.\nGold Creek’s emergency action program, like FFG’s before it, relies upon local emergency responders to\nperform firefighting, rescue, and medical duties during liquid nitrogen releases and other emergencies.\nHowever, the policy has no provision for interaction with those local responders to inform them of and prepare\nthem for the emergencies to which Gold Creek expects them to respond. Therefore, the CSB recommends to\nGold Creek to include in its emergency action program provisions for proactively interacting with and informing\nlocal emergency response resources of all emergencies at the former FFG Plant 4 facility to which Gold Creek\nexpects them to respond. At a minimum, Gold Creek should:\na) inform local emergency responders of the existence, nature, and location of hazardous substances at its\nfacilities, including liquid nitrogen;\nb) inform local emergency responders of the location of emergency-critical equipment such as bulk storage\ntanks, points of use, isolation valves, E-stop switches, and any other emergency equipment or systems\nwith which emergency responders may need to interact; and,\nc) provide local emergency responders with information, such as facility plot plans, engineering drawings,\nor other information needed to mount an effective emergency response.\n4.3.4 EMERGENCY STOPS\nAs shown below in Figure 20, the FFG Line 4 freezer room was equipped with 10 E-stop buttons, which were\ndesigned to shut down the immersion and spiral freezers as well as to close the liquid nitrogen supply valves to\nthe freezers.\n58\nInvestigation Report\nFigure 20. Locations of the Line 4 immersion-spiral freezer E-stops at the time of the incident. (Credit: CSB)\nAs shown, the 10 E-stop buttons consisted of five buttons on each freezer; one on either side of the inlet and\noutlet of each freezer, and one on each HMI panel. All 10 buttons were located within the freezer room. The\nresult of this placement was that activation of any of the E-stop buttons required someone to approach the source\nof the release to activate an E-stop. As stated earlier, FFG had no employees equipped for or trained in\nemergency response, and as a result, after the release began, no one at the company could safely activate any of\nthe E-stops.a The only way that anyone at the company could safely shut off the flow of liquid nitrogen during\na\nAs discussed above, the two FFG maintenance workers may have had the opportunity to activate an E-stop and avert the release, but it\nwas impossible to determine whether the two workers were aware of the bent bubbler tube, whether they had sufficient knowledge and\ntraining to understand what hazard the bent tube presented, or to what extent the workers were aware of the impending overflow.\n59\nInvestigation Report\nan uncontrolled release was by manually closing the bulk storage tank discharge valves, which were located\noutside, and at the other end of, the building.\nThe CSB concludes that the placement of the Line 4 immersion-spiral freezer E-stop buttons required a\nresponding employee or person not otherwise in the freezer room to enter an oxygen-deficient atmosphere\nduring a release of liquid nitrogen to activate an E-stop. This design was unsafe. As a result, once FFG’s two\nmaintenance workers became incapacitated, the uncontrolled liquid nitrogen release could not be safely stopped\nuntil employees manually closed valves at the bulk liquid nitrogen storage tanks outside of the building, or until\nemergency responders equipped for entry into an oxygen-deficient atmosphere could enter the freezer room and\nactivate an E-stop. Safer placement of E-stop buttons, and effective employee training on their use, might have\nhelped prevent the death of some or all of the four employees who perished during emergency response.\n4.3.5 INDUSTRY GUIDANCE FOR EMERGENCY SHUTOFF LOCATION\nVarious industry groups offer guidance on the proper design and location of emergency shutoff systems for use\nwith processes such as the one at FFG.\nISO 13850\nISO 13850 Safety of machinery – Emergency stop function – Principles for design is an international standard\npublished by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Regarding the placement of E-stops, the\nstandard requires a risk assessment, and states:\nAn emergency stop device shall be located:\n- At each operator control station, except where the risk assessment\nindicates that this is not necessary;\n- At other locations, as determined by the risk assessment, e.g.;\n- At entrance and exit locations;\n- At locations where intervention to the machinery is needed, e.g.\noperations with a hold-to-run control function;\n- At all places where a [human]/machine interaction is expected\nby design.\nEmergency stop devices shall be positioned so that they are directly accessible\nand capable of non-hazardous actuation by the operator and others who could\nneed to actuate them [25, p. 7].\nThis guidance, though general, could potentially have reduced the severity of this incident had it been\nimplemented at the FFG facility.\n60\nInvestigation Report\nThe CSB concludes that had FFG and Messer installed E-stop buttons outside the Line 4 freezer room, such as\nat the entrances to the room or at the bulk storage tanks, the uncontrolled release could have been stopped more\nexpediently.\nAn example of such a design philosophy is shown below in Figure 21:\nFigure 21. An example of potential additional safer E-stop placement. (Credit: CSB)\nCGA P-76\nCGA P-76 Hazards of Oxygen-Deficient Atmospheres explicitly identifies liquid nitrogen food freezers as an\nexample of equipment that can produce oxygen-deficient atmospheres [6, p. 5]. Section 6 of the standard\ncontains specific guidance on hazard mitigation and preventive measures for such systems. The standard states\nthat pipelines carrying inert gases “should be provided with a readily accessible isolation valve outside the\n61\nInvestigation Report\nbuilding” [6, p. 7]. The standard states that such valves “Ideally […] should be remotely activated by push\nbuttons or other safety-monitoring equipment” [6, p. 7]. As discussed above, remotely operated emergency\nisolation valves (ROEIVs) were installed on the liquid nitrogen supply piping to the FFG Line 4 liquid nitrogen\nfreezers, but the E-stop buttons to activate them were all located within the immediate vicinity of the freezers.\nAs currently written, CGA P-76 only recommends that equipment using inert gases should be equipped with\nisolation valves, and only recommends that those valves ideally should be remotely activated. This guidance is\ntoo permissive; as demonstrated by this incident and others (Table 4, Section 4.4.2.1), cryogenic asphyxiants\nand inert gases can produce multiple-fatality incidents in the event of loss of containment. Further, the standard\ncontains no guidance on the proper location of remote activation devices (such as E-stop buttons). The CSB\nrecommends that the CGA update P-76 Hazards of Oxygen-Deficient Atmospheres. At a minimum, the updated\nstandard should:\na) Require that processes, equipment, and piping systems capable of producing oxygen-deficient\natmospheres shall be equipped with remotely operated emergency isolation valves (ROEIVs).\nb) Include guidance on the adequate safe location of emergency stop devices. At a minimum this guidance\nshould be harmonized with the requirements of ISO 13850 Safety of machinery – Emergency stop\nfunction – Principles for design. As necessary, augment the general guidance of ISO 13850 with\nguidance specific to processes, equipment, and piping using cryogenic asphyxiants and inert gases.\nIn Section 4.2.3, the CSB recommended that the CGA develop a comprehensive liquid nitrogen standard\ncontaining guidance on the use of atmospheric monitoring and alarm systems. The CSB also recommends that\nthat standard include requirements and guidance on the location of emergency shutdown devices such as E-\nstops.\nNFPA 55\nNFPA 55 Compressed Gases and Cryogenic Fluids Code contains specific guidance on the use of bulk oxygen\nsystems, bulk liquefied hydrogen systems, bulk carbon dioxide systems, and liquid nitrous oxide systems,a but\nnot for liquid nitrogen systems. For cryogenic liquid systems other than those with specific guidance (those\nlisted above), NFPA 55 requires that the use of such systems comply with CGA P-18 Standard for Bulk Inert\nGas Systems (Section 4.2.2.5).b\nFor the use of all cryogenic fluids including liquid nitrogen, NFPA 55 requires that “accessible manual or\nautomatic emergency shutoff valves shall be provided”c and that such valves be located at the point of use, at the\ntank or bulk source, and at the point where the system piping enters the building [22, p. 41].d The standard also\nrequires that “manual emergency shutoff valves or the device that activates an automatic emergency shutoff\nvalve […] shall be identified by means of a sign” [22, p. 41].e The phrase “devices that activate an automatic\nemergency shutoff valve” applies to both manual emergency push buttons (E-stops) as well as atmospheric\na\nNFPA 55 § 9; § 11; § 13; § 16. (2020 ed.)\nb\nNFPA 55 § 8.13.11.1 (2020 ed.); § 8.13.11.2.1 (2020 ed.)\nc\nNFPA 55 § 8.13.11.2.3.1 (2020 ed.)\nd\nNFPA 55 § 8.13.11.2.3.2 (2020 ed.)\ne\nNFPA 55 § 8.13.11.2.3.1.(A) (2020 ed.)\n62\nInvestigation Report\nmonitoring devices interlocked to ROEIVs. However, the standard contains no guidance on the adequate\nlocation of such devices. The CSB recommends to NFPA to update NFPA 55 Compressed Gases and Cryogenic\nFluids Code to include guidance on the adequate safe location of manual shutoff valves and devices such as\nemergency push buttons used to activate remotely operated emergency isolation valves (ROEIVs). At a\nminimum this guidance should be harmonized with the requirements of ISO 13850 Safety of machinery –\nEmergency stop function – Principles for design.\nIFC\nThe IFC requires that “shutoff valves shall be installed in piping containing cryogenic fluids where needed to\nlimit the volume of liquid discharged in the event of piping or equipment failure [21, pp. 55-4].”a The standard\ndoes not specify whether shutoff valves should be manually or automatically actuated and offers no guidance on\nthe safe location of manual shutoff valves or devices used to remotely activate shutoff valves.\nTherefore, the CSB recommends that the ICC update the IFC to include guidance on the adequate safe location\nof manual shutoff valves and devices such as emergency push buttons used to activate remotely operated\nemergency isolation valves (ROEIVs) in cryogenic fluid service. At a minimum this guidance should be\nharmonized with the requirements of ISO 13850 Safety of machinery – Emergency stop function – Principles for\ndesign.\na\nIFC § 5505.1.2.3.2\n63\nInvestigation Report\n4.4 PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\nOSHA and EPA do not define liquid nitrogen as a highly hazardous chemical or extremely hazardous substance,\nand therefore neither OSHA’s Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard nor EPA’s Risk Management\nProgram (RMP) Rulea applies to liquid nitrogen processes, such as the Line 4 freezer process at FFG [26, 27].\nBecause of this, no regulation required FFG to implement process safety managementb practices for its liquid\nnitrogen freezer process.\nCCPS’s Guidelines for Risk Based Process Safety presents a broadly accepted framework for process safety\nmanagement consisting of 20 elements to help organizations design and implement more effective process\nsafety management systems [28, p. 2]. The CCPS developed the Risk Based Process Safety (RBPS) approach in\nresponse to the stagnation and decline of process safety management system implementation that it perceived\nwithin many organizations [28, p. 1]. The CCPS lists several possible causes of process safety management\nperformance stagnation, including:\n• In the United States, process safety management has become synonymous with OSHA’s PSM\nregulation, meaning organizations may fail to manage process safety when not required by regulation.\n• Since worker injuries are much more frequent and are easier to measure, company resources\ndisproportionately focus on personal safety rather than process safety.\n• Process safety management was developed by and for big companies. Small companies may believe\nthey do not have the capability to implement these systems [28, p. 2].\nRBPS was intended as a framework that companies of any size and risk profile can adapt to their operations.\nRegardless of the applicability of PSM regulatory requirements, RBPS was an applicable guideline available for\nFFG to establish an effective process safety management system.\n4.4.1 FFG’S INEFFECTIVE PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT\nPRACTICES\nFFG did not have an established process safety management program to identify and control the hazards of the\nliquid nitrogen process. The following sections present key process safety management elements that, if FFG\nhad implemented, may have prevented the incident or mitigated its severity.c\na\nIn addition to nitrogen, anhydrous ammonia (a highly hazardous chemical/extremely hazardous substance) was present on the FFG site\nat the time of the incident. However, FFG claimed that the ammonia within each process was below the threshold quantity that would\nhave required it to conform to the PSM standard and RMP rule. This report does not analyze FFG’s anhydrous ammonia processes,\nexcept by noting that FFG did not have an established process safety management system.\nb\nThis report distinguishes the terms “process safety management” (lower case) as the practices used to improve process safety and\n“Process Safety Management (PSM)” to refer to OSHA’s PSM standard.\nc\nThe CSB identified issues and missed opportunities with FFG’s safety practices related to many of the RBPS process safety\nmanagement elements. This report, however, will highlight only those elements that were causal or presented an opportunity to prevent\nor mitigate the incident.\n64\nInvestigation Report\n4.4.1.1 Process Safety Culture and Leadership Responsibility\nThe RBPS element Process Safety Culture discusses how the combination of group values and behaviors\ndetermines how process safety is managed [28, p. 40]. “The process safety culture of an organization is a\nsignificant determinant of how it will approach process risk control issues, and process safety management\nsystem failures can often be linked to cultural deficiencies” [28, p. 41]. The CCPS acknowledges that\nmanagement systems, policies, and procedures depend on individuals for their successful implementation [28, p.\n42]. Accordingly, the CCPS provides the following guidance for ensuring an organization maintains an effective\nprocess safety culture:\nThe leadership of an organization has the primary responsibility for identifying\nthe need for, and fostering, cultural change and for sustaining a sound culture\nonce it is established [28, p. 44].\nVisible, active, and consistent support for process safety programs and objectives\nexists at all levels of management within the organization. […] The concept of\nprocess safety as a line responsibility is carried down through all levels of the\norganization [28, p. 46].\nThe organization provides clear delegation of, and accountability for, safety-\nrelated responsibilities. Accordingly, employees are provided the necessary\nauthority and resources to allow success in their assigned roles. Personnel accept\nand fulfill their individual process safety responsibilities, and management\nexpects and encourages the sharing of process safety concerns by all members of\nthe organization [28, p. 47].\nThe organization places a high value on the training and development of\nindividuals and groups. […] The organization maintains a sufficient level of\nexpertise required for safe operations [28, p. 47].\nInclude in each manager’s job description explicit responsibilities that support\nprocess safety culture initiatives […]. Provide accountabilities for successfully\ncarrying out these responsibilities [28, p. 59].\nAfter Prime-Pak and Victory Processing formed the FFG joint venture in 2018, the safety responsibilities from\nthe two organizations were reorganized. FFG reassigned the EHS Manager from Victory Processing and the\nSafety Coordinator from Prime-Pak into a new structure within the FFG Human Resources (HR) Department. In\naddition, FFG discontinued the Safety Coordinator’s practice of performing regular safety walkthroughs of the\nfacility. By September 2019, the Safety Coordinator had resigned, and the EHS Manager had been was\nterminated. Positions with responsibility for safety management were vacant for at least 15 months, until\nDecember 2020, when FFG assigned EHS management responsibilities to the FFG Wastewater Manager, within\nthe Maintenance Department, less than two months prior to the incident. Figure 22 shows the safety\nmanagement organizational structure at the time of the incident.\n65\nInvestigation Report\nFigure 22.

This role was\nresponsible for worker’s compensation, accident reports, and occupational injury investigations such as slips, falls, and cuts. This role\nhad no explicit responsibility for implementation of a safety program, process safety, or safety training.\n66\nInvestigation Report\n4.4.1.2 Process Hazard Analysis\nThe RBPS element Hazard Identification and Risk Analysis encompasses all activities involved in identifying\nhazards and evaluating risk at a facility throughout the facility’s life cycle, to ensure that risks to workers, the\npublic, and the environment are consistently controlled. The analysis should assess and ask:\n• Hazard – What can go wrong?\nKEY LESSON\n• Consequences – How bad could it be?\n• Likelihood – How often might it happen [28, p. 210]? A PHA can only be effective\nif it is specific to the process\nThe understanding of risk developed from these exercises helps form the it evaluates.

Good procedures describe\nthe process, hazards, tools, protective equipment, and controls in enough detail that operators understand the\nhazards, can verify that controls are in place, and can confirm that the process responds in an expected manner”\n[28, pp. 245-246].\nFFG did not develop written procedures for the operation or maintenance of the liquid nitrogen freezer. In\naddition, Messer did not provide FFG with any operating manuals for the freezer equipment prior to the\na\nWhile Section 4.1.2 discusses the design PHA inadequacies as it relates to identification and management of safety-critical safeguards,\nthe process owner/operator is ultimately responsible for PHA execution. As a distinction from Section 4.1.2, this section highlights the\nabsence of FFG’s PHA execution for its specific process.\n67\nInvestigation Report\nincident.a FFG relied on verbal communications with Messer for information on operating the freezer. As the\nFFG Plant 4 Maintenance Manager described:\nThe freezer for Line 4 and the [immersion] freezer, we did not have any\ndocuments or any type of books yet […] Usually I’m used to, any time a new\nmachine comes in, I get a box full of manuals and all kinds of stuff. […] And,\nhonestly, I wasn’t really too concerned about the book right now because I had\n[the Messer Sales Engineer] here. He was my book…\nThere was insufficient evidence to determine how the bubbler tube was bent. One of the hypotheses the CSB\nconsidered and tested was intentional or unintentional human manipulation of the bubbler tube. Although the\nCSB could not determine whether anyone manipulated the tube, proper maintenance procedures and training\ncould have better informed employees about safety-critical devices, which might have prevented the release.\nThe CSB concludes that FFG did not have written procedures to operate or maintain the liquid nitrogen freezer,\nand therefore the FFG employees were not provided with clear instructions and precautions in operating the\nequipment. Had FFG developed clear written procedures, it is likely that the FFG workers would have\nunderstood the function of the freezer, the importance of critical components, and proper precautions when\noperating and troubleshooting the equipment, which may have prevented the release.\n4.4.1.4 Management of Change\nThe RBPS element Management of Change ensures that changes to a process do not inadvertently introduce\nnew hazards or increase the risk of existing hazards [28, p. 424]. A proper management of change program will\nrecognize change situations, evaluate hazards associated with the change, decide whether to allow the change to\nbe made, and complete necessary risk control measures [28, p. 423]. According to CCPS, organizations should\nestablish and implement procedures to manage changes that address:\n• the technical basis for the proposed change;\n• impact of the proposed change on safety and health; and\n• authorization requirements for the proposed change [28, p. 435].\nChange from Ammonia to Liquid Nitrogen Freezers\nAs discussed in Section 1.2, FFG installed the liquid nitrogen immersion-spiral freezer in 2020 to expand the\ncapabilities and increase efficiency of the Line 4 product line. The new freezer system could be utilized as an\nalternative to the previously used ammonia spiral freezer in the adjacent room. To support product flow, FFG\nselected the Lower Dry Storage Room, a storage space recessed from some of the surrounding rooms, and\nwithout mechanical ventilation (shown in Figure 23), to house the new liquid nitrogen freezer equipment.\na\nIn a post-incident civil lawsuit deposition, a Messer employee stated that not only did Messer not provide the manuals to FFG, but that\nthe manuals weren’t fully written yet and were still being updated to reflect the customizations made to the FFG Line 4 freezers even\nafter the freezers had begun operation.\n68\nInvestigation Report\nFigure 23. The former Lower Dry Storage room was selected to house the Line 4 liquid nitrogen freezer\nequipment. (Credit: FFG, annotations by CSB)\nFFG modified the Lower Dry Storage room by adding walls to separate the immersion-spiral freezer from the\nadjacent areas of the plant and constructed a clean room opposite the equipment., Other than the installation of\nthe liquid nitrogen freezer equipment, FFG made no other major modifications to the Lower Dry Storage area.\nFFG did not have an established management of change process and did not consider how changes to the\nprocess, building, and equipment could impact process safety.\nReview and Approval of Changes\nFFG completed a Capital Expenditure Request in 2020 to manage and approve the building modifications\nrequired for the liquid nitrogen freezer transition. The request included a description of the necessary building\nand equipment modifications, a project justification that considered impacts to production and efficiency, and\napprovals by the Senior Vice President of Operations, Senior Vice President of Sales, Chief Financial Officer,\nand Chief Executive Officer (CEO).a The Capital Expenditure Request was not approved by anyone with\nexplicit responsibility for safety, however, and the Safety Manager role was vacant until December 2020. The\nrequest did not include a technical basis for the change and did not consider process safety.\nFailure to Consider Equipment Location Risks\nThe Dry Product Storage room, where the liquid nitrogen freezer was ultimately installed, was recessed roughly\nfive feet from the floor of two of the surrounding rooms, as shown in Figure 24 and discussed in Section 1.4.\na\nA similar process was used to approve Line 2 modifications. In 2019, FFG completed a Capital Expenditure Request to install a new\nliquid nitrogen spiral freezer on Line 2, which included the same review and approval authorities as the 2020 Line 4 request.\n69\nInvestigation Report\nFigure 24. Immersion freezer room recessed nearly five feet from two adjacent rooms. (Credit: CSB)\nThe only openings in the freezer room at the same level as the floor were the standard-sized door leading to the\nclean room and the large doorway leading to the warehouse and loading dock (which was partially enclosed by a\nheavy plastic strip curtain). The other two openings in the room were both elevated roughly five feet above the\nfloor of the room.\nUltimately, between the floor and roughly five feet of elevation, two of the walls in the freezer room were fully\nenclosed, one was nearly fully enclosed (containing only a standard-sized door for personnel entry and exit), and\nthe fourth had a large doorway that was partially enclosed by heavy plastic strip curtains (which partially\nrestricted airflow through the door). As a result, the portion of the room most susceptible to oxygen\ndeficiency—the lower portions of the room, since cold nitrogen vapors are heavier than air—was nearly fully\nenclosed, and thus was easily capable of retaining a large volume of cold, vaporized nitrogen.\nCGA P-76 Hazards of Oxygen-Deficient Atmospheres provides guidance on controlling asphyxiation hazards\nwhen handling cryogenic liquids:\nPoorly ventilated areas, […] enclosures, and low-grade areas can contain\noxygen-deficient atmospheres. […] An oxygen-deficient atmosphere can bring\nabout unconsciousness without warning. In as little as one or two breaths, an\nindividual’s life can be endangered by low oxygen intake [6, p. 4].\n70\nInvestigation Report\nIn processes where cryogenic liquids are handled and vaporization takes place,\ncare shall be taken to avoid situations where personnel are exposed to oxygen\ndeficiency. Examples of such spaces include […] rooms where liquid nitrogen\nfood freezers are operated […] [6, p. 5].\nCGA P-76 provides additional guidance on required ventilation within enclosed spaces:\nExamples of enclosures include […] rooms where inert cryogenic liquid is used\nor stored. Building/room size, ventilation capacity, and system pressures shall be\ndetermined for each specific case. The following control measures may be\napplied to ventilation system design:\n• Continuous ventilation while the hazard exists. This can be achieved by\ninterlocking the ventilation system with the process power supply;\n• Adequate air flow around the normal operating areas;\n• Minimum ventilation capacity of 6 air changes per hour [6, p. 8].\nThe Dry Product Storage room was not equipped with HVAC or mechanical ventilation, and FFG did not install\nventilation after the installation of the liquid nitrogen freezer. As the Plant 4 FFG Maintenance Manager\ndescribed:\nThere’s not an HVAC system in that room. We open the wall from our oven room\narea to allow air to flow […] through our makeup air system.\nThe CSB concludes that FFG did not have a management of change process to identify, assess, and manage risk\nintroduced by process changes. During the introduction of the liquid nitrogen immersion-spiral freezer, FFG did\nnot consider how the change could impact process safety, did not include approval authorities with explicit\nresponsibilities for safety, and did not address conformance with industry guidance. As a result, FFG did not\nmanage the risks associated with using a mostly enclosed, partially recessed room without mechanical\nventilation and installed the liquid nitrogen freezer in an area particularly susceptible to an oxygen-deficient\natmosphere.\n4.4.1.5 Training, Hazard Awareness, and Communication\nThe RBPS element Training and Performance Assurance describes practical instruction in job requirements and\nmethods to enable workers to meet performance standards and maintain proficiency [28, p. 396]. According to\nCCPS:\n• A set of training materials should be developed for each training need [28, p. 397].\n• A training record should be provided for each worker showing that person’s training needs, the dates on\nwhich initial training and any refresher training was satisfactorily completed, and a schedule of future\ntraining classes [28, p. 397].\n71\nInvestigation Report\n• An appropriate approach for verifying performance should be documented [28, p. 397].\n• Examiners should be provided with the resources necessary to test workers [28, p. 397].\n• In addition to the specific task training, the training program should provide workers with an overview\nof the process and an understanding of its hazards [28, p. 402].\nIn addition, the RBPS element Workforce Involvement states that “workers, at all levels and in all positions in an\norganization, should have roles and responsibilities for enhancing and ensuring the safety of the organization’s\noperations” [28, p. 124]. An effective process safety management system “provides workers the information\nnecessary to understand the hazards to which they may be exposed” [28, p. 126] and “requires the active\ninvolvement of workers who (1) are aware of the hazards in the workplace, (2) understand the engineered\ncontrols and management systems provided to address those hazards, and (3) accept and strive to fulfill their\nroles and responsibilities in support of providing a safe work environment” [28, p. 128].\nFurthermore, CGA P-76 Hazards of Oxygen Deficient Atmospheres states that individuals who handle or use\ninert gases shall be trained and informed of safety measures, hazards of release, and the potential for oxygen\ndepletion [6, p. 6].\n4.4.1.6 Lack of Training\nWhile FFG maintenance workers received training on general\noccupational safe work practices, such as lock-out/tag-out, FFG did not KEY LESSON\ndevelop training plans to provide its workers with specific, documented\ntraining on the function and operation of the liquid nitrogen freezer\nIt is critical for workers to be\nsystem.

Implementing a\nrobust process safety program is important to a company’s overall success.” [56].

As a\nresult, FFG employees at all levels of the organization were not aware of the hazards of liquid nitrogen and were\nunaware of precautions that should have been taken.\n4.4.1.7 Lack of Hazard Communication\nCGA P-76 Hazards of Oxygen-Deficient Atmospheres specifies that, along with a proper training program\ndiscussed above, areas with potential asphyxiation hazards shall be identified or have restricted access. CGA\nprovides an example of a warning sign used to communicate the risk of asphyxiation hazards (Figure 25).\nFigure 25. Example of a warning sign for asphyxiation hazard [6, p. 7]. (Credit: CGA)\nNeither FFG nor Messer provided such warning signage for the asphyxiation hazard in the Line 4 freezer room,\nas shown in Figure 26. By not restricting entrance to the freezer room or providing adequate warning signage,\nworkers were able to enter the freezer room unaware of the potential asphyxiation hazards.\n74\nInvestigation Report\nFigure 26. Lack of warning signs for the presence of liquid nitrogen and asphyxiation hazard at the entrance to\nthe freezer room from the loading dock (left) and clean room (right). (Credit: CSB and Messer)\nIn addition, the freezer equipment included no signage warning of the risks of liquid nitrogen. OSHA’s Hazard\nCommunication (HazCom) standard requires employers to label containers of hazardous chemicals with words,\npictures, and/or symbols to provide information regarding hazards.a As part of the equipment installation,\nMesser provided liquid nitrogen warning labels (with both English and Spanish text) to be affixed to the freezer\nequipment, as shown in Figure 27. However, these labels were stored within a folder inside the freezer HMI and\nwere never affixed to the freezer. Neither FFG nor Messer applied the labels to the equipment prior to the\nincident, and thus the information was not properly displaced to workers.\na\n29 CFR 1910.1200(f)(6)(ii)\n75\nInvestigation Report\nFigure 27. Liquid nitrogen warning labels were located inside the HMI and were not affixed to equipment.\n(Credit: CSB)\nThe CSB concludes that had the liquid nitrogen freezer equipment and the entrance to the Line 4 freezer room\nbeen affixed with proper warning signage and labels, workers could have been made aware of the asphyxiation\nrisks within the room.\n76\nInvestigation Report\n4.4.1.8 Conclusions\nKEY LESSON\nThe CSB concludes that FFG lacked an effective process safety\nmanagement system to identify, evaluate, and control the hazards of the\nFood manufacturers are not\nliquid nitrogen process.

Therefore, the CSB does not\norganization to do so.\nissue a recommendation to Gold Creek related to process safety\nmanagement of liquid nitrogen processes.\n4.4.2 LACK OF REGULATIONS FOR CRYOGENIC ASPHYXIANTS\nAs discussed in Section 4.4, the FFG liquid nitrogen freezer process was not subject to OSHA’s PSM standard\n(or EPA’s RMP rule). In addition, there is no existing regulation that requires organizations that handle or\nprocess cryogenic asphyxiants to adhere to the requirements of CGA, CCPS, or any safe handling and safety\nmanagement system guidelines.\n4.4.2.1 Fatalities from Liquid Nitrogen Release Incidents\nBy OSHA’s definition, a highly hazardous chemical is “a substance possessing toxic, reactive, flammable, or\nexplosive properties” [26].a Since liquid nitrogen is not toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive, it does not meet\nOSHA’s definition of a highly hazardous chemical.b Regardless, uncontrolled liquid nitrogen releases have\nresulted in serious injuries and fatalities in several industries. Since 2008, the CSB is aware of at least seven\nincidents involving liquid nitrogen that have resulted in 13 fatalities in the United States, as shown in Table 4.\nNone of these incidents were subject to a regulated process safety management standard for liquid nitrogen.\na\n29 CFR 1910.119(b)\nb\nLiquid nitrogen meets the CSB’s definition of an “extremely hazardous substance,” which is defined in 40 CFR 1604.2 as “any\nsubstance which may cause death, serious injury, or substantial property damage […].”\n77\nInvestigation Report\nTable 4.

Since OSHA’s standards cover\nFFG and its workers, the violations cited by OSHA at the FFG facility prior to and following the January 2021\nincident provide insight into the scope of applicable existing regulations.\nOSHA Citations Prior to the FFG Incident\nBetween 2016 and 2020, OSHA inspected the FFG facility three times, as shown in Table 5. While OSHA\nfound several violations, OSHA did not document any findings or concerns relating to FFG’s handling of liquid\nnitrogen during these visits.\nTable 5.

As shown in Figure 28, OSHA’s findings included\nviolations related to walking-working surfaces, stairs, exit routes, PPE, confined space, control of hazardous\nenergy, first aid, HazCom, and the General Duty Clause. None related directly to FFG’s handling of liquid\nnitrogen, however.\nFigure 28. Summary of OSHA violations issued to FFG post-incident. (Credit: CSB)b\na\nDuring this inspection, the plant was operated by Prime Pak.\nb\nAll references are to 29 CFR 1910 and are abbreviated in the figure for presentation.\n79\nInvestigation Report\nSince there is no specific OSHA standard governing the use of liquid nitrogen, there is a serious gap in\nregulations that address preventative and mitigative measures to safely handle liquid nitrogen and other\ncryogenic asphyxiants. As discussed below, there are several regulations that applied to FFG and apply to other\nusers of liquid nitrogen. None of the existing regulations would have prevented the accidental release, however.\nHazard Communication (29 CFR 1910.1200)\nOSHA’s HazCom standard found in 29 CFR 1910.1200 is intended to “ensure that the hazards of all chemicals\nproduced […] are classified, and that information concerning the classified hazards is transmitted to employers\nand employees” [30].a The standard “requires chemical manufacturers […] to classify the hazards of chemicals\nwhich they produce […], and all employers to provide information to their employees about the hazardous\nchemicals to which they are exposed, by means of a hazard communication program, labels and other forms of\nwarning, safety data sheets, and information and training” [30].b\nAs discussed in Section 4.4.1.5, had FFG better informed its workforce about the presence and hazards of liquid\nnitrogen, its workers may not have decided to enter the freezer room to attempt to rescue their coworkers. This\ncould have reduced the severity of the incident by preventing some or all of the additional four employee deaths\nand three serious injuries. More effective hazard communication likely would not have prevented the accidental\nrelease.\nControl of Hazardous Energy (29 CFR 1910.147)\nOSHA’s Control of Hazardous Energy (Lockout/Tagout) standard found in 29 CFR 1910.147 “covers the\nservicing and maintenance of machines and equipment in which the unexpected energization or start up of the\nmachines or equipment, or release of stored energy could cause injury to employees” [31].c The standard\n“requires employers to establish a program and utilize procedures for affixing appropriate lockout devices or\ntagout devices to energy isolating devices, and to otherwise disable machines or equipment to prevent\nunexpected energization, start-up or release of stored energy in order to prevent injury to employees” [31].d\nSince this incident involved the failure of a safety-critical level control device during active troubleshooting\nactivities, proper energy isolation activities may have impacted the outcome of this incident. As discussed in\nSection 2.2.1, two FFG workers were attempting to troubleshoot the liquid nitrogen flow without turning off the\nfreezer or isolating the flow of liquid nitrogen when the release began. However, even if the flow of nitrogen\nhad been isolated during the troubleshooting, at some point the workers likely would have unlocked and re-\nengaged the flow, likely resulting in the same outcome. Isolating the nitrogen flow likely would not have\nprevented the damage to the bubbler tube. As identified in OSHA’s investigation, FFG did not adhere to many\nof the requirements of the Control of Hazardous Energy standard.e However, in this particular incident, the\nControl of Hazardous Energy standard would not have prevented the release or the subsequent fatalities.\na\n29 CFR 1910.1200(a)(1)\nb\n29 CFR 1910.1200(b)(1)\nc\n29 CFR 1910.147(a)(1)(i)\nd\n29 CFR 1910.147(a)(3)(i)\ne\nFFG has contested the Lockout/Tagout violations.\n80\nInvestigation Report\nGeneral Duty Clause (Section 5(a)(1))\nThe Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act of 1970, Section 5(a)(1), also known as the General Duty\nClause, requires employers to “furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which\nare free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his\nemployees” [32]. While the General Duty Clause requires employers to ensure that the workplace is free from\nrecognized hazards, it is a reactive regulation that OSHA relies upon to cite employers for hazards that are not\nexplicitly covered in other regulations. The General Duty Clause contains no guidance on how to prevent\nincidents.\nHAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120)\nOSHA’s HAZWOPER standard found in 29 CFR 1910.120 applies to “emergency response operations for\nreleases of, or substantial threats of releases of, hazardous substances without regard to the location of the\nhazard,” among other subjects [33].a The standard requires that employers develop an ERP that addresses\n“emergency recognition and prevention” [33].b The standard regulates response to an incident that has already\noccurred and does not prevent incidents in the first place. Additionally, the standard simply requires employers\nto develop a plan that “addresses” prevention, with no specific guidance or requirements on how to do so.\nIn general, the HAZWOPER standard seeks to prevent untrained employees from responding to an incident. The\nregulation requires employers to either develop an EAP (in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.38) that requires and\ntrains all employees to evacuate all emergencies, or to develop an ERP (in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.120)\nthat requires that employees designated for response activities be properly trained and equipped for response. In\neither case, employees who are not trained to respond must not respond. In the FFG incident, numerous\nuntrained people responded to the liquid nitrogen release by entering the Line 4 freezer room or rooms adjacent\nto it. Nevertheless, OSHA did not cite FFG for violating the HAZWOPER standard or for violating the EAP\nrequirements of 29 CFR 1910.38. As noted in Section 4.3, FFG had an EAP purportedly intended for\ncompliance with 29 CFR 1910.38, meaning that at the policy level, FFG elected not to respond to any\nemergencies and instead evacuate. However, among the people who responded were management officials who\nwould have been responsible for implementing FFG’s asserted policy of evacuation without response.\nOther Regulations Cited by OSHA\nMany of the OSHA-cited violations issued in response to the Line 4 incident were not relevant to the liquid\nnitrogen release, as discussed below:\n• Confined Space (29 CFR 1910.146) – The incident did not involve confined space entry.\n• Exit Routes (29 CFR 1910.36-37) – Given the nature of the release, the egress path available to the\nworkers likely did not contribute to this incident.\na\n29 CFR 1910.120(a)(1)(v)\nb\n29 CFR 1910.120(q)(2)(iii)\n81\nInvestigation Report\n• First Aid (29 CFR 1910.151)a – The availability of an eye wash station or safety shower is irrelevant to\nthis incident.\n• PPE (29 CFR 1910.132) – The availability of differing PPE for workers would not have prevented the\naccidental release, although it could have lessened the severity of the incident had responding workers\nbeen equipped with personal oxygen monitors or equipment suitable for entry into an oxygen-deficient\natmosphere.\n• Stairs (29 CFR 1910.25) – The condition of stairs is irrelevant to this incident.\n• Walking-Working Surfaces (29 CFR 1910.22) – The condition of walking surfaces is irrelevant to this\nincident.\nOSHA’s Recommended Practices for Safety and Health Programs\nIn response to other similar liquid nitrogen asphyxiation incidents,b OSHA has urged employers to follow\nOSHA’s Recommended Practices for Safety and Health Programs, a voluntary resource that includes\nManagement Leadership, Hazard Identification and Assessment, Hazard Prevention and Control, and Education\nand Training [34, 35]. However, OSHA’s Recommended Practices for Safety and Health Programs are not\nenforceable.\n4.4.2.3 Emphasis Programs\nAccording to OSHA,\nLocal Emphasis Programs (LEPs) are enforcement strategies designed and\nimplemented at the regional office and/or area office levels. These programs are\nintended to address hazards or industries that pose a particular risk to workers in\nthe office’s jurisdiction. The emphasis programs may be implemented by a single\narea office, or at the regional level (Regional Emphasis Programs [REPs]), and\napplied to all of the area offices within the region. These LEPs will be\naccompanied by outreach intended to make employers in the area aware of the\nprogram as well as the hazards that the programs are designed to reduce or\neliminate [36].\nCurrently, there are three REPs covering the meat and poultry processing industry; Region 4 [37] (covering\nAlabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee), Region 5\n[38] (covering Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin), and Region 6 [39] (covering\nArkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas). The Region 4 REP became effective on April 1,\na\nThis OSHA-cited violation concerned availability of an eye wash and safety shower in the vicinity of corrosive materials.\nb\nIn response to the November 2019 asphyxiation fatality caused by a release of liquid nitrogen at the Custom Genetic Solutions LLC in\nMitchell, South Dakota, OSHA issued a press release that states: “OSHA’s Recommended Practices for Safety and Health Programs\nprovides employers with a plan for managing safety and health within their workplaces, including hazard identification and assessment,\nhazard prevention and control, and education and training.” [34]\n82\nInvestigation Report\n2022 (after the incident at FFG), and the Regions 5 and 6 REPs became effective on October 1, 2023. The REPs\ncover the elements shown in Table 6 below.\nTable 6. Regions 4, 5, and 6 meat and poultry industry REP elements.\nRegion 4 (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, Region 5 (IL, IN, MI, MN, OH,\nNC, SC, TN) WI)\nOSHA Recordkeeping Machine Guarding\nMedical Records Control of Hazardous Energy\nErgonomics Hazard Communication\nProcess Safety Management Other Hazards\nConfined Spaces Region 6 (AR, LA, NM, OK,\nTX)\nElectrical Hazards OSHA Recordkeeping\nHazard Communication Medical Records\nHexavalent Chromium Ergonomics\nMachine Guarding/Lockout- Process Safety Management\nTagout\nBiological Hazards Hazard Communication\nOther Hazards Machine Guarding/Lockout-\nTagout\nBiological Hazards\nOccupational Noise Hazards\nAmong the “other hazards” included in the Region 4 REP, OSHA inspectors are directed to “identify and\nevaluate potential chemical or physical hazards including carbon dioxide [and]…non-PSM refrigerant\nchemical[s] [37, p. 15].” Likewise, the Region 5 REP includes “refrigeration chemicals (e.g., carbon dioxide,\nammonia) [38, p. 27].” Liquid nitrogen is not specifically mentioned in any of the REPs.\nApplicability of Liquid Nitrogen within Current REPs\nEmphasis programs are an important tool for OSHA to proactively inspect facilities for common hazards prior to\nan incident occurring. They also generate data for potential future rulemaking actions. OSHA currently has three\nactive REPs that cover the meat and poultry processing industries. None of the existing REPs specifically\nmention liquid nitrogen, although the Regions 4 and 5 REPs cover “non-PSM refrigerant” chemicals and\n“refrigeration chemicals,” respectively.\nIt is unclear whether the Region 4 REP (which covers the state of Georgia, where the FFG incident occurred)\nwould have applied to FFG’s liquid nitrogen processes had it been in effect prior to the incident. Its application\ndepends on OSHA’s interpretation of the word “refrigerant.” The Region 6 REP covers PSM-regulated\n83\nInvestigation Report\nchemicals such as ammonia freezing and refrigeration processes or chlorine used for water treatment processes\nbut lacks the same provision for non-PSM substances that the Region 4 REP contains. Therefore, the CSB\nrecommends that OSHA:\n• Update the Region 4 Poultry Processing Facilities Regional Emphasis Program to explicitly cover liquid\nnitrogen freezing processes. At a minimum, the update should encourage practices applicable to\nmanaging the hazards of using liquid nitrogen and other cryogenic asphyxiants, including process safety\nmanagement practices, atmospheric monitoring, employee training and hazard awareness, and\nemergency preparedness and response;\n• Update the Region 5 Regional Emphasis Program for Food Manufacturing Industry to explicitly cover\nliquid nitrogen freezing processes. At a minimum, the update should encourage practices applicable to\nmanaging the hazards of using liquid nitrogen and other cryogenic asphyxiants, including process safety\nmanagement practices, atmospheric monitoring, employee training and hazard awareness, and\nemergency preparedness and response; and,\n• Update the Region 6 Poultry Processing Facilities Regional Emphasis Program to explicitly cover liquid\nnitrogen freezing processes. At a minimum, the update should encourage practices applicable to\nmanaging the hazards of using liquid nitrogen and other cryogenic asphyxiants, including process safety\nmanagement practices, atmospheric monitoring, employee training and hazard awareness, and\nemergency preparedness and response.\n4.4.2.4 Conclusions\nAs discussed throughout this report, there is abundant industry guidance concerning the proper handling and\nsafety management of cryogenic asphyxiants and cryogenic systems. CCPS provides guidance on the design of\ninstrumented systems (Section 4.1), the execution of PHAs (Section 4.1), the use of atmospheric monitoring\n(Section 4.2.2.2), and the implementation of a process safety management system (Section 4.4). CGA requires\nthe use of atmospheric monitoring (Section 4.2.2.3), provides guidance on isolation valve placement and design\n(Section 4.3.5), presents facility design considerations (4.4.1.4), requires proper hazard communication and\ntraining (Section 4.4.1.5), and provides guidelines for process safety management systems (Section 4.5.2).\nNFPA requires the use of atmospheric monitoring (Section 4.2.2.5) and the installation of emergency isolation\nvalves (Section 4.3.5).\nDespite the plethora of industry guidance, none of these requirements and guidelines are currently enforceable\nby regulation.\n84\nInvestigation Report\nThe CSB concludes that there is no regulation requiring employers\nhandling or processing cryogenic liquid asphyxiants, such as liquid KEY LESSON\nnitrogen, to adhere to industry guidance concerning proper design and\nsafe handling, nor to implement a robust and systematic approach to\nRegulations are minimum\nprocess safety.

In situations like FFG, where the owner and operator of a process are two\ndifferent companies (FFG operated the equipment, but Messer owned it), responsibility for safety should be\nshared. Despite FFG’s poor safety practices, Messer had the expertise, ability, and opportunity to take effective\naction to prevent this incident or reduce its likelihood or severity.\nProduct stewardship refers to the management practice supporting a philosophy of service to customers and\nminimizing effects on health and the environment throughout the complete life cycle of a product [40].\nThe American Chemistry Council (ACC), a trade organization that represents chemical companies in the United\nStates, provides product stewardship guidelines through its Responsible Care® program [41, 42]. According to\nthe ACC, Responsible Care® companies are committed to a culture of continual improvement in product safety\nand product stewardship for each stage of a product’s life cycle. As part of this, the ACC developed the Product\nSafety Code, which provides a set of practices to manage chemical product safety and enhance it as part of its\nindustry’s health, safety, security, and environmental management system. The Product Safety Code requires\nthat companies include product safety and product stewardship as part of their management systems. According\nto the ACC, product safety includes exchanging information regarding product hazards, intended uses, handling\npractices, exposures, and risks. The ACC describes product stewardship as the responsibility to understand,\nmanage, and communicate the health and environmental impacts throughout the life cycle of chemical products.\nThe customers of member companies and users of the members’ products are an important focus of product\nstewardship [43, 44].\n4.5.1 MESSER’S PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP PRACTICES\nMesser is a member of the ACC’s Responsible Care® program and has stated its commitment to the Responsible\nCare® Guiding Principles “to work with customers, carriers, suppliers, distributors and contractors to foster the\nsafe and secure use, transport and disposal of chemicals and provide hazard and risk information that can be\naccessed and applied in their operations and products” [45]. However, in a statement to the CSB, Messer\nclarified that its food freezer business had not been audited and certified under its Responsible Care® program,\nstating:\nCurrently, the Food Freezer Market business is not part of the Responsible Care\nCertification Program. The Food Freezer Markets business is scheduled for\ninclusion into the certification program beginning in year 2024 […]. As it relates\nto Messer-installed equipment at FFG, only the bulk liquid nitrogen storage tanks\nwere developed using the Responsible Care Management System Guidelines.\nRegardless, as part of the Line 4 liquid nitrogen freezer startup effort, Messer completed a product stewardship\nchecklist with FFG employees, with the stated purpose to “document the suggested customer interface training\nand submittals to [e]nsure Messer is providing good safe customer stewardship of our products and services.”\nHowever, while specific items in the checklist were marked as complete, FFG never signed the checklist\n86\nInvestigation Report\nacknowledging completion of the items. Furthermore, the CSB found inconsistencies between items marked\ncomplete by Messer and actual implementation, as shown in Table 7.\nTable 7. Messer Responsible Care checklist items.\nAction Verified? CSB Observations\n(As marked by Messer)\n“Discuss risk assessment results, Yes Although the checklist item stated only to\npotential exposures, and mitigation “discuss” the results of a risk assessment,\nwith customer.” FFG never performed a risk assessment,\nand Messer did not provide the previously\nperformed PHA to FFG prior to startup.\n(Section 4.4.1.2)\n“Delivered all required manuals.” Not yet As the checklist indicated, Messer did not\nprovide FFG with equipment, operating,\nor maintenance manuals prior to the\nincident. (Section 4.4.1.3)\n“Training completed: safety and Yes Messer provided hands-on operational\npotential hazards, safe gas handling, training and a verbal overview of the\nequipment O&M, [and] process. equipment to three FFG maintenance\nAttendance list documented to employees (two maintenance technicians\nMesser and Customer.” and the Line 4 Packing Supervisor, all\nthree of whom were fatally injured), but\nthe training content was not documented.\n(Section 4.4.1.5)\n“All decals and warning signs in Yes Decals and warning signs were never\nplace – Messer equipment, piping affixed to equipment or room entries.\n…, room entries…” (Section 4.4.1.5)\n“Atmosphere monitoring use Yes Although the checklist item stated only to\ndiscussed.” “discuss” the use of monitoring,\natmospheric monitors were not installed in\nthe freezer room in accordance with\nMesser’s recommendation, and workers\nwere not provided with personal detectors.\n(Section 4.2.1)\nFormer Practices\nPrior to the Messer’s acquisition of Linde’s liquid nitrogen freezer business (see Section 1.1.2), Linde provided\ncustomers with a detailed awareness training presentation on the hazards of oxygen deficiency and asphyxiation\nwhen handling nitrogen. This training included a list of several minimum requirements and key\nrecommendations for customers, including ensuring that:\n• safety information sheets are kept as a record by the customer;\n• the customer is aware of safety documentation from gas industry associations, such as CGA;\n87\nInvestigation Report\n• information on relevant safety services is available locally to safeguard against asphyxiation;\n• gas analyzers are in the correct location, are calibrated, and function;\n• ventilation systems are operational and effective; and\n• adequate warning signs are in place.\nLinde stated that its “Duty of Care” to customers was to:\n…provide a good design and installation of equipment [and] take appropriate\naction if unsafe use of Linde products becomes apparent (i.e. being a responsible\nsupplier). […] In high risk [situations, Linde] will have to consider terminating\nsupply. (emphasis added)\nAfter Messer’s acquisition of Linde’s liquid nitrogen freezer business, Messer did not continue Linde’s “Duty of\nCare” practices.\n4.5.2 INEFFECTIVE PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP\nPrior to and following the startup of the liquid nitrogen freezer system, Messer was aware of FFG’s poor safety\npractices. Nevertheless, Messer continued to supply FFG with liquid nitrogen despite FFG’s failure to correct\nthe issues. Examples of Messer’s inadequate product stewardship are presented below.\nCommitment to Process Safety\nThe CGA is a trade association that develops safety standards and safe practice guidelines for the industrial,\nmedical, food, and specialty compressed and liquefied gases industries [46]. The CGA’s standards and\nguidelines are applicable to liquid nitrogen freezers, such as the one Messer leased to FFG. Messer is a CGA\nmember company and is therefore aware of the CGA’s standards and their applicability.\nCGA P-86, Guideline for Process Safety Management presents 21 process safety management elements in its\nprocess safety framework, as shown in Table 8 [47, pp. 3-4].\nTable 8. CGA P-86 Process Safety Management elements.\nCGA CGA Process Safety Management Element CGA CGA Process Safety Management Element\nElement Element\nNumber Number\nProcess Safety Leadership Risk Management\n1 Leadership Commitment and Responsibility 8 Process and Operational Status Monitoring\nand Handover\n2 Compliance with Legislation and Industry 9 Operating Procedures\nStandards\n3 Employee Selection, Training, and 10 Management of Operational Interfaces\nCompetency\n4 Workforce Involvement 11 Standards and Practices\n5 Communication and Stakeholders 12 Management of Change\n88\nInvestigation Report\nCGA CGA Process Safety Management Element CGA CGA Process Safety Management Element\nElement Element\nNumber Number\nRisk Identification and Assessment 13 Operational Readiness and Process Startup\n6 Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment 14 Emergency Management\n7 Documentation, Records, and Knowledge 15 Inspection and Maintenance\nManagement\nReview and Improvement 16 Management of Safety Critical Devices\n19 Incident Investigation 17 Work Control, Permit-to-Work, and Task Risk\nManagement\n20 Audit, Management Review, and Intervention 18 Contractors and Suppliers\n21 Measures and Metrics\nAccording to the CGA, “The process safety management framework may be applied to all processes within the\nindustrial […] gases industry. It is designed to address process safety hazards and be equally suitable for the\nprocesses that are found in the industry including […] customer installations.” (emphasis added) [47, p. 1].\nCGA P-86 Element 5, Communication with stakeholders, states:\nIn relation to major hazards, management shall identify key stakeholder groups\nand develop and maintain a good working relationship […], understanding and\naddressing their issues and concerns. […] External stakeholders may include […]\ncustomers. (emphasis added) [47, p. 7].\nAppropriate safety information is shared with stakeholders to demonstrate the\norganization’s commitment to process safety. (emphasis added) [47, p. 7].\nCGA P-86 Element 6, Hazard identification and risk assessment, states:\n[Organizations] should ensure that a comprehensive risk assessment process\nsystematically identifies, assesses, and provides mitigations for the risks arising\nfrom […] operations [47, p. 7].\nRisk assessments consider process safety risk as well as risk to […] asset\nintegrity, […] and customers. (emphasis added) [47, p. 8].\nIdentified stakeholders are kept informed about the risk assessment process and\nresults [47, p. 8].\nAs discussed in Section 4.4.1, FFG did not have an established process safety management system and lacked\nmany important process safety management practices. FFG further lacked the institutional knowledge and\nexperience required to implement such practices. Conversely, industrial gas suppliers like Messer have\nextensive expertise with and knowledge of the process safety risks posed by the materials and equipment they\nprovide to their customers.\n89\nInvestigation Report\nWhile the owner or operator of a facility has the ultimate responsibility to implement effective practices and\nsafeguards to manage process safety risks and to protect its workers, industrial gas suppliers are often more\nknowledgeable of the hazards of their products and equipment than their customers, as was the case with Messer\nand FFG. Thus, companies like Messer should work with their customers to ensure effective process safety\nmanagement practices are utilized, particularly when the knowledge base and experience required to do so may\nnot be present at the customer level.\nAwareness of the Absence of Atmospheric Monitoring\nDuring a site visit to a separate Plant 4 production linea in August 2020, Messer recognized that FFG did not\nhave proper atmospheric monitoring based on the hazards posed by the cryogenic liquids being handled. In\nresponse, the Messer Sales Engineer sent an email to the FFG Senior Vice President of Operations stating:\n[Messer] highly recommend[s] the use of permanently mounted [o]xygen and\n[carbon dioxide] monitors augmented with the use of personal/portable monitors\nas part of the plant’s safety system.\nAlong with this notification in August 2020, Messer provided FFG with information on Messer’s Responsible\nCare initiative and information on how to obtain atmospheric monitors, as shown in Figure 29.\nFigure 29. Excerpt from Messer’s notification to FFG on the need for atmospheric monitoring. (Credit: Messer)\nAs discussed in Section 4.2.1, FFG continued to operate the freezer without atmospheric monitoring at the time\nof the incident.\nAwareness of No Mechanical Ventilation and Risks Presented by Freezer Location\nAs discussed in Section 4.4.1.4, the FFG Line 4 freezer room was not equipped with either HVAC or industrial\nventilation. During the freezer installation, Messer was aware of the lack of mechanical ventilation in the room\nFFG selected to install the freezer equipment. The exhaust system installed on the freezer equipment required a\na\nThe process line being observed handled cryogenic carbon dioxide, which poses an asphyxiation hazard similar to liquid nitrogen.\n90\nInvestigation Report\nsupply of fresh air to replenish air removed from the exhaust system, called make-up air. Contractually, Messer\nprovided the make-up air volume calculation to FFG, and FFG was responsible for ensuring the ventilation\nrequirements were met. In a post-incident interview with the CSB, the Messer Project Manager conveyed\nconcerns about the lack of ventilation and insufficient make-up air in the freezer room:\nUsually, customers have massive make-up air units in their room, so when you\nadd [the freezer] in there, it doesn’t matter. You’re still going to get the\ncirculation. Some of them actually have to add blowers to the make-up air units\nto basically compensate for what we’re taking out.\n[In the Line 4 freezer room], I didn’t see any make-up air, what we call forced\ncirculation.\nThe Messer Project Manager added:\n[Messer doesn’t] do a whole HVAC calculation and assess the actual size of the\nroom and calculate what’s going on. We just know that this freezer’s [exhaust is]\npulling this amount of air from the room, and if you want to maintain the integrity\nof that room, just make sure you can replace that same, make sure that same\nsupply is in there.\nAs discussed in Section 4.4.1.4, FFG relied on the opening from the adjacent processing room to supply make-\nup air. This method of supplying make-up air is unreliable, as described by the Messer Project Manager:\nWith the […] opening, that’s natural circulation. So we don’t count on natural\ncirculation as flow because that can vary and it’s very hard to measure. We count\non forced circulation. So that means you put a certain make-up air unit in there.\nYou know what it is. You can count on it. And it’s shooting in the space, and it’s\ndoing its job.\nFollowing a site visit elsewhere in the facility in August 2020, the Messer Sales Engineer sent an email to the\nFFG Senior Vice President of Operations conveying concerns about FFG’s general ventilation design:\nMesser would like to emphasize the need for adequate ventilation/exhaust\nsystems to ensure the plant atmosphere contains levels of [carbon dioxide] and\n[nitrogen] below exposure limits and oxygen levels are above 19.5%.\nFFG did not address the ventilation concerns. As discussed in Sections 4.4.1.4 and 4.2.1, FFG continued to\noperate the freezer without mechanical room ventilation and atmospheric monitoring and alarm systems.\nMesser also would have been aware that the room was mostly enclosed above five feet of elevation and nearly\nfully enclosed below five feet of elevation. Despite the inherent risks of the Line 4 freezer room, Messer did not\nobject to FFG’s placement of the freezer, either in the proposal stage or the construction stage, and Messer\n91\nInvestigation Report\ncontinued to supply FFG with liquid nitrogen. Messer was leasing the freezer to FFG and could have objected to\nthe placement of the freezer, suspended liquid nitrogen supply, or terminateda the agreement.\nAwareness of Defeated Interlocks\nOn January 26, 2021, two days prior to the incident, the Messer Sales Engineer was observing the Line 4\nimmersion-spiral freezer when he discovered that an interlocked freezer door was open while the freezer was\noperating, a condition that normally would automatically shut down nitrogen flow to the freezer. According to\nthe Messer Sales Engineer, when the door and lid safety are properly installed, it is not possible to open the door\nduring operations under normal conditions:\nThose doors have to be shut in order for the freezer to operate. So they’re all\nsealed during operation. If you open those doors, those magnetic switches will\nalarm and shut off everything and ramp up the exhaust to full speed.\nUpon discovering this situation, the Messer Sales Engineer verbally informed the FFG Maintenance Manager\nthat the inoperable interlock posed a safety hazard and needed to be repaired:\nWell, initially the machine was in a shutdown mode so the machine was not\nactually running, and so I had no response to the transition door being open under\nthose conditions. But once they started running the machine and I noticed that\nthe transition box door was still open, I recognized that that is not a condition\nthat is acceptable. And I told [the FFG Maintenance Manager] and the\nmaintenance guy that that is an unsafe condition and that it needed to be repaired.\nDuring the investigation, the CSB determined that the transition box door and freezer lid safety switches had\nbeen tampered with such that they were defeated, as shown in Figure 30. In the as-found condition, the system\nwould recognize the door and lid as closed, regardless of their actual positions, allowing the door or lid to be\nopened to access the freezer interior even when the freezer was operational. As the Messer Sales Engineer told\nthe CSB:\nThat magnet has been removed from the door and taped to the switch. Somebody\nhas removed the magnet from the door and taped it to the switch so they can open\nthe door while the freezer’s running.\na\nSince Messer owned the immersion-spiral freezer, FFG contractually would not be able to replace Messer with a different liquid\nnitrogen supplier without also replacing the equipment.\n92\nInvestigation Report\nFigure 30. Defeated transition box door safety switches. (Credit: CSB)\nPrior to the incident, the Messer Sales Engineer did not report this condition to anyone at Messer, purportedly\nbecause he was told by FFG’s maintenance personnel that the switches would be restored to their proper\npositions. Nevertheless, FFG had not repaired the defeated interlocked door switches prior to the incident.\nThe CSB concludes that Messer did not practice effective product stewardship prior to the incident. Messer was\naware of several instances of FFG’s process safety deficiencies and poor safety practices yet still commissioned\nthe freezer to FFG. Using more effective product stewardship, Messer could have prevented this incident by 1)\nobjecting to the placement of the freezer in a room particularly susceptible to oxygen deficiency, 2) refusing to\ncommission its freezer equipment until FFG provided adequate atmospheric monitoring and alarm systems, 3)\nsuspending supply of liquid nitrogen until safety deficiencies had been addressed, or 4) ending the relationship\nwith FFG and removing its equipment.\n4.5.3 MESSER POST-INCIDENT ACTIONS\nFollowing the incident, Messer has implemented a new product stewardship safety program, which includes a\nsafety assessment process for freezer equipment and associated supply piping at Messer customer sites,\napplicable to sites where Messer supplies liquid nitrogen and liquid carbon dioxide. As part of the program,\nMesser will perform safety inspections when engaging in new business or additional use for new food freezer\napplications, at customer request, or when a Messer employee notes a concern. Additionally, Messer will\nperform a safety inspection for all existing food freezing customers. The safety inspections will include reviews\nof:\n• atmospheric conditions;\n• atmospheric monitoring interlocked into cryogenic liquid supply;\n• exhaust systems;\n93\nInvestigation Report\n• cryogenic liquid piping supply application equipment;\n• pressure relief devices;\n• material compatibility;\n• safety permissives, interlocks, and alarms;\n• equipment clearances;\n• SDS;\n• product training materials; and\n• equipment manuals and drawings.\nWhen engaging in new business, Messer requires the following at a customer site:\n• Permanently mounted atmospheric monitoring interlocked into application equipment or emergency\nshut off valves that shut off supply of cryogenic liquid when in an alarm state;\n• Proof of exhaust installed and interlocked into all application equipment that will not allow the flow of\ncryogenic liquid when exhaust is not operating;\n• Safe cryogenic liquid piping systems installed; and\n• Presence of Messer nitrogen and/or carbon dioxide SDS and product safety sheets, and product safety\ntraining materials.\nFor existing customers, Messer established a color-coded rating system, as shown in Figure 31. In response to a\ncustomer rating of Red, Messer may choose to shut down the customer process.\n94\nInvestigation Report\nFigure 31. Messer customer safety rating system (Credit: Messer)\nThe CSB concludes Messer’s newly developed customer safety inspection program provides a robust review of\nliquid nitrogen customer safety practices and can help prevent future incidents similar to the one at FFG.\nDespite these positive changes, Messer’s product stewardship program does not involve any review or\nparticipation in a customer’s PHA, a critical practice in which facility- and process-specific hazards are\nidentified and controlled. Although Messer cannot force its customers to conduct a PHA or to hire a third party\nto conduct a PHA, Messer can participate in PHAs conducted by those customers willing to do so and can\nconsider taking any of the product stewardship actions discussed above for those customers unwilling to do so.\nAs discussed in Section 4.5.2, CGA P-86 states that organizations should complete a comprehensive risk\nassessment to consider process safety risks to customers. In addition, as discussed in Section 4.1.2, CCPS\nGuidelines for Hazard Evaluation Procedures provides guidance on PHA execution. Additionally, Messer’s\nproduct stewardship program does not involve the verification of proper signage, labeling, and hazard\ncommunication, nor does it explicitly mention emergency shutoff devices (E-stops). Therefore, the CSB\nrecommends that Messer update the company product stewardship policy to:\na) include participation by Messer in customers’ process hazard analyses (PHAs). The policy should\nrequire that these PHAs be conducted in a manner which conforms with CCPS Guidelines for Hazard\nEvaluation Procedures prior to the startup of a cryogenic freezing process;\nb) require verification that proper signage, in accordance with CGA P-76 Hazards of Oxygen-Deficient\nAtmospheres, is displayed on and/or near equipment; and\nc) require a facility and/or equipment siting review to ensure that emergency shutoff devices, including E-\nstops, are located such that they can be safely actuated during a release of liquid nitrogen.\nIn addition, the CSB recommends that Messer create an informational product that provides Messer customers\nwith information on the safety issues described in this report. In this informational product, recommend that\nMesser customers develop and implement effective safety management systems to control asphyxiation hazards\nfrom inert gases based on the guidance published in CGA P-86 Guideline for Process Safety Management, CGA\nP-12 Guideline for Safe Handling of Cryogenic and Refrigerated Liquids, CGA P-18 Standard for Bulk Inert\nGas Systems, and CGA P-76 Hazards of Oxygen-Deficient Atmospheres.\n95\nInvestigation Report\n5 CONCLUSIONS\n5.1 FINDINGS\nTechnical Analysis\n1. Liquid nitrogen overflowed from the immersion freezer. The liquid nitrogen overflow was caused by the\nfailure of the freezer’s level control and high-level safety interlock systems.\n2. The failure of the freezer’s level control and high-level safety interlock systems was caused by the\ndeformation of the bubbler tube.\n3. The bubbler tube was likely bent on the morning of the incident during maintenance troubleshooting\nactivities, likely between 8:20 a.m. and approximately 9:30 a.m.\n4. There was insufficient evidence to determine exactly when the tube was bent. Therefore, the CSB was\nnot able to determine precisely when the uncontrolled release began.\n5. The CSB was not able to definitively determine how the tube was bent.\n6. The CSB could not determine whether the two maintenance workers had sufficient awareness, time, and\nability to avert the release by activating an E-stop or to escape the room safely prior to the loss of\ncontainment.\n7. The uncontrolled release of liquid nitrogen likely ceased at approximately 10:15 a.m. when the bulk\nstorage tank manually-operated discharge valves, located outside the building, were closed.\n8. At most, approximately 6,300 gallons (approximately 42,400 pounds) of liquid nitrogen released from\nthe FFG Line 4 immersion freezer, though the actual released quantity was likely less. There was\ninsufficient evidence to determine the exact quantity of released liquid nitrogen because it was not\npossible to determine when the release began.\n9. The released liquid nitrogen vaporized, collected in the freezer room, and produced an oxygen-deficient\natmosphere inside the room.\nSingle Point of Failure\n10. The immersion freezer was designed such that the failure of a single level measurement device could\ndefeat both the nitrogen level control system and the emergency interlock intended to stop nitrogen flow\nto the freezer. After the bubbler tube was bent, there was nothing to prevent the nitrogen release from\nthe freezer.\n11. Linde did not design the immersion-spiral freezer in accordance with industry guidance regarding single\npoints of failure for instrumented systems. Had Linde or Messer included additional independent\nsafeguards to protect against overflow events, this incident could have been prevented.\n96\nInvestigation Report\n12. Linde did not adequately consider the failure of the liquid nitrogen level control system and did not\nidentify appropriate safeguards to mitigate the potential failure. In essence, Linde incorrectly identified\nthe bubbler tube as a safeguard for itself.\n13. Linde did not identify specific incident scenarios or cause-consequence pairs when conducting the PHA\nfor the immersion-spiral freezer, which resulted in Linde’s failure to identify adequate safeguards to\nprotect against the overflow of liquid nitrogen from the immersion freezer.\n14. Messer’s Quality Control procedures and practices were ineffective in ensuring that the two support\nclamps on the bubbler tube were in place at the time of inspection. As a result, Messer failed to identify\nthe missing support clamp during Quality Control inspection.\n15. The combination of unsecured tubing length and support clamp location worsened the potential for the\nbubbler tube to become bent, which ultimately resulted in the bubbler system becoming non-functional.\nAtmospheric Monitoring and Alarm Systems\n16. Messer informed FFG of the need for atmospheric monitoring of its liquid nitrogen processes on at least\nthree occasions. Despite Messer’s recommendations, neither FFG nor Messer took action to install\nmonitoring or alarm equipment on the Line 4 process, which could have alerted workers to the presence\nof an oxygen-deficient atmosphere, and, if designed accordingly, could have triggered an emergency\nshutdown of the liquid nitrogen systems.\n17. FFG did not follow industry guidance concerning the use of atmospheric monitoring and alarms for its\nliquid nitrogen process, and as a result, many personnel were unaware that the freezer room was unsafe\nto enter on the day of the incident.\n18. Had Messer or FFG properly considered, designed, installed, tested, and maintained an atmospheric\nmonitoring and alarm system in the freezer room, workers would have been warned against entering the\noxygen-deficient atmosphere, which could have prevented the subsequent fatalities and serious injuries\nto FFG workers.\n19. Industry guidance for carbon dioxide is extensive. Comparable, specific guidance for liquid nitrogen\ncould help prevent future incidents similar to the one at FFG.\nEmergency Preparedness\n20. Although FFG had a written emergency action plan, it was severely inadequate to address a liquid\nnitrogen emergency. Its inadequacies included 1) that it was not written in Spanish, the primary\nlanguage of many of FFG’s workers; 2) that it made no mention of the existence of liquid nitrogen at the\nfacility; 3) that it made no mention of the hazards of liquid nitrogen; 4) that it had no instructions for\nhow, whether, or when to respond to a release of liquid nitrogen other than general evacuation\ninstructions; 5) that it contained no information or plan for how employees were to be notified of an\nemergency; 6) that it contained no information on what constituted an emergency or what types of\nemergencies to which employees might need to respond; and 7) that it had no provision for proactively\ninteracting with local emergency responders despite the company’s stated practice of relying on them\nfor emergency response.\n97\nInvestigation Report\n21. As a result of FFG’s poor emergency communication, employees attempting to respond to the incident\nor evacuate the building were only minimally informed, if at all, of the nature and severity of the\nemergency.\n22. The four workers who subsequently were fatally injured were attempting some sort of response to the\nrelease.\n23. FFG did not prepare its workforce in any meaningful way to respond to a release of liquid nitrogen. The\ncompany’s deficiencies included 1) its lack of emergency response training for its workforce, 2) its lack\nof employee training on how to identify a liquid nitrogen release, 3) the lack of automated means to\ndetect and inform its workers of a liquid nitrogen release, and 4) insufficient direction to its employees\nnot to respond or attempt rescue during a liquid nitrogen release.\n24. As a result of FFG’s unpreparedness, the severity of the incident was greatly increased during\nevacuation and response activities when four additional employees were fatally injured, three employees\nwere seriously injured, and at least seven others sustained minor injuries or were uninjured but easily\ncould have been seriously or fatally injured. Had FFG effectively prepared its workforce for a liquid\nnitrogen release, the four additional fatalities and three of the four serious injuries could have been\nprevented.\n25. Gold Creek’s policy documents and emergency procedures are more robust than FFG’s emergency\naction plan was at the time of the incident and could have reduced the severity of this incident had FFG\nimplemented similar policies and procedures.\n26. The placement of the Line 4 immersion-spiral freezer E-stop buttons required a responding employee or\nperson not otherwise in the freezer room to enter an oxygen-deficient atmosphere during a release of\nliquid nitrogen to activate an E-stop. This design was unsafe. As a result, once FFG’s two maintenance\nworkers became incapacitated, the uncontrolled liquid nitrogen release could not be safely stopped until\nemployees manually closed valves at the bulk liquid nitrogen storage tanks outside of the building, or\nuntil emergency responders equipped for entry into an oxygen-deficient atmosphere could enter the\nfreezer room and activate an E-stop. Safer placement of E-stop buttons, and effective employee training\non their use, might have helped prevent the death of some or all of the four employees who perished\nduring emergency response.\n27. Had FFG and Messer installed E-stop buttons outside the Line 4 freezer room, such as at the entrances\nto the room or at the bulk storage tanks, the uncontrolled release could have been stopped more\nexpediently.\nProcess Safety Management System\n28. For several months prior to the incident, FFG’s safety management organization did not include\nemployees with direct responsibility over the safety practices. Had FFG established process safety\nprograms and objectives; assigned qualified personnel clear responsibilities over process safety\nmanagement; defined, implemented, and tracked process safety objectives; and ensured organization\nleaders demonstrated commitment to process safety principles, FFG could have prevented the incident.\n98\nInvestigation Report\n29. FFG did not identify or evaluate hazards specific to its process, such as the liquid nitrogen overflow and\nasphyxiation risks, and did not implement effective controls to mitigate the risk.\n30. FFG did not have written procedures to operate or maintain the liquid nitrogen freezer, and therefore the\nFFG employees were not provided with clear instructions and precautions in operating the equipment.\nHad FFG developed clear written procedures, it is likely that the FFG workers would have understood\nthe function of the freezer, the importance of critical components, and proper precautions when\noperating and troubleshooting the equipment, which may have prevented the release.\n31. FFG did not have a management of change process to identify, assess, and manage risk introduced by\nprocess changes. During the introduction of the liquid nitrogen immersion-spiral freezer, FFG did not\nconsider how the change could impact process safety, did not include approval authorities with explicit\nresponsibilities for safety, and did not address conformance with industry guidance. As a result, FFG did\nnot manage the risks associated with using a mostly enclosed, partially recessed room without\nmechanical ventilation and installed the liquid nitrogen freezer in an area particularly susceptible to an\noxygen-deficient atmosphere.\n32. FFG had no system, plan, or program to train and verify the competency of its employees when\noperating the liquid nitrogen freezer and working with or near hazardous liquid nitrogen. As a result,\nFFG employees at all levels of the organization were not aware of the hazards of liquid nitrogen and\nwere unaware of precautions that should have been taken.\n33. Had the liquid nitrogen freezer equipment and the entrance to the Line 4 freezer room been affixed with\nproper warning signage and labels, workers could have been made aware of the asphyxiation risks\nwithin the room.\n34. FFG lacked an effective process safety management system to identify, evaluate, and control the\nhazards of the liquid nitrogen process. The lack of safety oversight by FFG leadership, absence of a\nsystematic process hazard analysis, lack of written procedures, lack of any management of change\npractices, and failure to communicate hazards resulted in the unmitigated handling of a cryogenic\nasphyxiant by untrained and unprepared personnel. This incident could have been prevented had FFG\npracticed robust process safety management.\n35. There is no regulation requiring employers handling or processing cryogenic liquid asphyxiants, such as\nliquid nitrogen, to adhere to industry guidance concerning proper design and safe handling, nor to\nimplement a robust and systematic approach to process safety. Because it was not required to, FFG did\nnot implement important process safety practices that could have either prevented the accidental release\nor reduced its severity.\n36. There is no specific guidance from OSHA on the process safety practices necessary for the safe use of\ncryogenic asphyxiants.\nProduct Stewardship\n37. Messer did not practice effective product stewardship prior to the incident. Messer was aware of several\ninstances of FFG’s process safety deficiencies and poor safety practices yet still commissioned the\nfreezer to FFG. Using more effective product stewardship, Messer could have prevented this incident by\n99\nInvestigation Report\n1) objecting to the placement of the freezer in a room particularly susceptible to oxygen deficiency, 2)\nrefusing to commission its freezer equipment until FFG provided adequate atmospheric monitoring and\nalarm systems, 3) suspending supply of liquid nitrogen until safety deficiencies had been addressed, or\n4) ending the relationship with FFG and removing its equipment.\n38. Messer’s newly developed customer safety inspection program provides a robust review of liquid\nnitrogen customer safety practices and can help prevent future incidents similar to the one at FFG.\n5.2 CAUSE\nThe CSB determined the cause of the liquid nitrogen release was the failure of the immersion freezer’s liquid\nlevel control system to accurately measure and control the liquid nitrogen level inside the freezer, which resulted\nfrom deformation of the system’s bubbler tube component.\nContributing to the incident were 1) Messer’s design of the freezer, which allowed the failure of a single level\nmeasurement device to result in an uncontrolled loss of containment of liquid nitrogen, 2) FFG’s lack of any\nprocess safety management systems or practices that could have prevented the incident, 3) a lack of regulatory\ncoverage for liquid nitrogen, which enabled FFG to elect not to implement process safety practices that could\nhave prevented the incident, and 4) Messer’s inadequate product stewardship practices, which resulted in Messer\ncontinuing to supply FFG with liquid nitrogen despite FFG’s unsafe practices.\nContributing to the severity of the incident were 1) FFG’s inadequate emergency preparedness, which resulted\nin at least 14 employees responding to the release by entering the freezer room or the surrounding area to\ninvestigate the incident or to attempt to rescue their coworkers, and 2) the absence of atmospheric monitoring\nand alarm devices that could have alerted workers to the presence of a hazardous atmosphere and warned them\nagainst entering.\n100\nInvestigation Report\n6 RECOMMENDATIONS\nTo prevent future chemical incidents, and in the interest of driving chemical safety excellence to protect\ncommunities, workers, and the environment, the CSB makes the following safety recommendations:\n6.1 GOLD CREEK FOODSa\n2021-03-I-GA-R1\nInclude in the emergency action program provisions for proactively interacting with and informing local\nemergency response resources of all emergencies at the former FFG Plant 4 facility to which Gold Creek\nexpects them to respond. At a minimum, Gold Creek should:\na) inform local emergency responders of the existence, nature, and location of hazardous substances at its\nfacilities, including liquid nitrogen;\nb) inform local emergency responders of the location of emergency-critical equipment such as bulk storage\ntanks, points of use, isolation valves, E-stop switches, and any other emergency equipment or systems\nwith which emergency responders may need to interact; and,\nc) provide local emergency responders with information, such as facility plot plans, engineering drawings,\nor other information needed to mount an effective emergency response.\n6.2 MESSER LLCb\n2021-03-I-GA-R2\nUpdate the company product stewardship policy to:\na) include participation by Messer in customers’ process hazard analyses (PHAs). The policy should\nrequire that these PHAs be conducted in a manner which conforms with CCPS Guidelines for Hazard\nEvaluation Procedures prior to the startup of a cryogenic freezing process;\nb) require verification that proper signage, in accordance with CGA P-76 Hazards of Oxygen-Deficient\nAtmospheres, is displayed on and/or near equipment; and,\na\nGold Creek has developed emergency response procedures that could have reduced the severity of this incident. Consequently, the CSB\nmakes no recommendations to Gold Creek pertaining to the development of emergency preparedness policies or employee training for\nits emergency action program. Additionally, as of this report’s publication, there are no liquid nitrogen freezing processes at the former\nFFG Plant 4 building which Gold Creek now operates. Consequently, the CSB makes no recommendation to Gold Creek related to\nprocess safety management practices for liquid nitrogen processes.\nb\nAfter the incident Messer revised its freezer design to include multiple layers of protection against liquid nitrogen overflow. Messer\nalso revised its Quality Control process and procedures to require verification of the presence of the necessary bubbler tube clamps and\nreordered the sequence of inspection steps to facilitate this verification. Consequently, the CSB makes no recommendation to Messer\nregarding the design of its immersion freezers or its Quality Control process.\n101\nInvestigation Report\nc) require a facility and/or equipment siting review to ensure that emergency shutoff devices, including E-\nstops, are located such that they can be safely actuated during a release of liquid nitrogen.\n2021-03-I-GA-R3\nCreate an informational product that provides Messer customers with information on the safety issues described\nin this report. In this informational product, recommend that Messer customers develop and implement effective\nsafety management systems to control asphyxiation hazards from inert gases based on the guidance published in\nCGA P-86 Guideline for Process Safety Management, CGA P-12 Guideline for Safe Handling of Cryogenic and\nRefrigerated Liquids, CGA P-18 Standard for Bulk Inert Gas Systems, and CGA P-76 Hazards of Oxygen-\nDeficient Atmospheres.\n6.3 U.S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (OSHA)\n2021-03-I-GA-R4\nUpdate the Region 4 Poultry Processing Facilities Regional Emphasis Program to explicitly cover liquid\nnitrogen freezing processes.

At a minimum this guidance should be harmonized with the requirements of ISO 13850\nSafety of machinery – Emergency stop function – Principles for design.\n104\nInvestigation Report\n7 KEY LESSONS FOR THE INDUSTRY\nTo prevent future chemical incidents, and in the interest of driving chemical safety excellence to protect\ncommunities, workers, and the environment, the CSB urges companies to review these key lessons:\n1. Processes and equipment that utilize hazardous materials should be designed robustly enough that the\nfailure of a single component cannot result in a catastrophic incident.\n2. Facilities that handle hazardous gases or cryogenic asphyxiants should have a functioning atmospheric\nmonitoring and alarm system based on a properly conducted risk assessment. Functioning atmospheric\nmonitoring systems consist of equipment that has been properly designed, installed, maintained,\ninspected, and tested and will alert personnel of a hazardous atmosphere using audible and visual\nalarms.\n3. Safety leadership begins with management. Designating competent and resourced staff with\nresponsibility over specific safety programs is key to ensuring effective process safety. Management\nmust be knowledgeable and involved in each of these safety programs to provide effective oversight.\n4. A PHA can only be effective if it is specific to the process it evaluates. Not considering facility-specific\nscenarios misses opportunities to effectively identify, evaluate, and control hazards. Companies\ninstalling equipment into a process at their facility should always perform a PHA considering the\nhazards introduced by the process, equipment, facility or room layout, surrounding area, and external\nfactors.\n5. It is critical for workers to be trained on the hazards of the materials they encounter. Non-flammable,\nnon-toxic chemicals, such as nitrogen, can be incorrectly assumed to be non-hazardous without proper\ntraining and hazard communication. Companies handling these materials have an obligation to train and\ninform their employees.\n6. Food manufacturers are not immune from chemical hazards and process safety risks. Whenever an\norganization introduces a hazardous chemical into its process, it should implement robust process safety\nmanagement practices to effectively control the risks, regardless of whether any regulation requires the\norganization to do so.\n7. Regulations are minimum requirements. The need for robust process safety management practices exists\nwherever hazardous chemicals are manufactured, processed, stored, and used, regardless of their\nregulatory coverage. Companies must be cognizant of the hazards posed by the chemicals they handle\nand should implement effective process safety management systems to control process safety risks.\n105\nInvestigation Report\n8 REFERENCES\n[1] Messer Americas, \"Messer Brings Gases Expertise to Americas, After Mess Group, CVC Close Acquisition,\" 1 March 2019.\n[Online].

The hot gases and\ndebris blown from the furnace broke through the double-pane reinforced glass window of the\ncontrol room, severely burning the two workers inside; they died within 24 hours from burn\ninjuries.\nCarbide Industries, LLC is the larger of two North American producers of calcium carbide\nand supplies calcium carbide primarily to the iron and steel industry and to acetylene1\nproducers. The main Carbide Industries facility is adjacent to the Ohio River in the\n“Rubbertown” section of western Louisville, KY. The company employs about 160 workers\nin operations, maintenance, and administration. The Louisville site operated one 50-mega-\nwatt (MW) EAF with the capacity to produce 120,000 tons of molten calcium carbide per\nyear. After draining the calcium carbide from the EAF and cooling it to a solid, the site\ngrinds and packages the solid into multiple grades of calcium carbide for sale. Although\nthe facility maintains an acetylene storage tank to collect fugitive acetylene gas from the\ncalcium carbide plant, the operation does not produce acetylene gas to sell.2\n1Adding water to calcium carbide produces acetylene gas and calcium hydroxide (lime). The acetylene gas is then purified to sell as welding gas and raw\nmaterial for producing other chemicals.\n2Carbide Industries burns the collected acetylene gas in a flare.\nCSB • Carbide Industries Case Study 2\nCarbide Industries Case Study Board Voting Copy February 2013\nOnly a few calcium carbide industry facilities operate in the United States. In addition to the\nCarbide Industries facility in Kentucky, Central Carbide Corporation in Pryor, OK, operates\na 17-MW electric arc furnace. Central Carbide Corporation is under the same ownership\nas Carbide Industries, LLC. Although the majority of EAFs used in the U.S. are for steel\nmanufacturing,3 similar chemical producing operations use EAFs in the ferrosilicon, silicon,\nand phosphorus industries.\n2.0 PROCESS DISCUSSION\n2.1. CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF CALCIUM CARBIDE\nPure calcium carbide (chemical formula CaC ) consists of two carbon atoms and one calcium\n2\natom; it melts at about 3500°F (1926°C). At room temperature, commercially produced\ncalcium carbide is a gray to black solid that is typically supplied as granules or powder con-\ntaining about 75 to 85 weight percent calcium carbide with 15 to 25 weight percent calcium\noxide and other impurities.\nCalcium carbide reacts with water, such as the humidity in air or the moisture in human tissues,\nto form acetylene gas (chemical formula C H ) and calcium hydroxide (chemical formula\n2 2\nCa(OH) ). Acetylene is an extremely flammable gas. Calcium hydroxide is a caustic solid that\n2\ncan irritate the skin and eyes on contact and can lead to severe respiratory irritation and\nacute pulmonary edema when inhaled.\n2.2. ELECTRIC ARC FURNACES FOR CALCIUM CARBIDE\nAn EAF passes electricity through the air above a material to heat that material (indirect arc\nfurnaces) and in some designs through the material as well (open arc and submerged arc\nfurnaces). The electricity enters the EAF through large conductors called electrodes. Calcium\ncarbide is manufactured in submerged arc EAFs through which electrodes protrude into the\nmaterial to be heated. Radiative heating occurs from the arc in the air around the material,\ndirect electrical resistance heating occurs as the electricity passes through the material, and\nconvective heating occurs as the hot gases formed in the arc percolate through the material.\nEAFs can generate temperatures in the thousands of degrees centigrade.\nThe calcium carbide process feeds coke4 pre-mixed with lime chunks (calcium oxide, (CaO))\nto the EAF, and the electrodes protrude through the furnace cover into the pile of coke and\nlime. As the EAF provides electricity, heating the feed material to temperatures above 4100°F,\nthe carbon in the coke reacts with the lime at high temperature to form liquid calcium carbide\nas a product and the toxic and flammable by-product carbon monoxide:\n∆\nCaO + 3C → CaC + CO\n2\nLime + carbon + heat → calcium carbide + carbon monoxide\nSince the coke contains some hydrogen atoms, the process also releases extremely flammable\nhydrogen gas (H ).\n2\n3According to the EPA, in 1999, there were 200 EAFs operated in US industry, 130 of which were used for steelmaking.\n4Coke, a solid carbon that contains some hydrogen, is a black solid produced by high-temperature processing of high boiling petroleum- or coal-based\nprocess streams and residues in an oxygen-free environment.\nCSB • Carbide Industries Case Study 3\nCarbide Industries Case Study Board Voting Copy February 2013\nFIGURE 2 2.3 EQUIPMENT DESCRIPTION\nThe EAF at Carbide Industries was located on the ground floor of the five-story furnace\nCutaway view of the EAF\nbuilding and location building (Figure 2). Due to the height of the furnace itself, the cover of the furnace was at the\nof victims at time of second floor level; the same level as the control room where the furnace operator controlled\nincident\nthe chemical and electrical feeds to the furnace. The control room had a window made of\ndual-paned, one-half-inch thick, wire-reinforced glass. Figure 3 shows that the control room\nwindow was about 12 feet from the furnace cover.\nThe furnace was a refractory-lined metal tank with three holes in the sidewall to drain the\nmolten calcium carbide product. These three-hole positions were at the elevation of the\nmezzanine level, between the second and ground floor. The furnace cover was about four feet\ntall and made of refractory-lined metal that was water cooled. The refractory prevented the\nhigh-temperature materials in the furnace from contacting and melting the metal tank and\ncover. The furnace cover was fabricated in several sections and bolted together. Cooling water\nflowed through each hollow section as additional protection against overheating.\nThree electrodes protruded through the furnace cover. The electrodes extended from the fifth\nfloor down to just below the second floor. Three transformers on the third floor supplied AC\npower to the electrodes.\nLocation of victims\nCSB • Carbide Industries Case Study 4\nCarbide Industries Case Study Board Voting Copy February 2013\nFIGURE 3\nSecond floor of the\nfurnace building and\nlocation of victims at the\ntime of the incident\nLocation of victims\nTanks on the fourth level held pre-mixed feed until a conveyor system dispensed the material\ninto chutes that distributed the feed around the furnace electrodes. The feed material flowed\ndown into the furnace through the gaps between the electrode sheaths and the holes that the\nelectrodes passed through in the furnace cover.\n2.4. PROCESS DESCRIPTION\nThe plant receives truck and rail deliveries of coke and lime respectively (Appendix A). An\noven dries the coke and a weighing system mixes the coke with the lime in the desired weight\nratio to feed the furnace. A system of tanks and chutes distributes the solid feed mixture (coke\nand lime) through the EAF cover and around the three electrodes.\nThe furnace contains hot feed material, liquid calcium carbide, and flammable and toxic gases\nthat are byproducts of the EAF, including hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The feed material\nfalls through the feed chutes into the furnace and floats on the surface of the liquid calcium\ncarbide, forming deep piles around each electrode.\nThe furnace runs under slight pressure to prevent air from being drawn into the furnace\nand igniting the flammable gases. The gases produced in the furnace exit primarily through\na vent system to a wet scrubber, a device that removes pollutants from gas through contact\nwith liquid. Some of the gas exits into the second floor of the furnace building through the\ngaps between the electrode sheaths and the holes that the electrodes pass through in the\nfurnace cover. In addition to monitoring electricity consumption, electrode consumption,\nCSB • Carbide Industries Case Study 5\nCarbide Industries Case Study Board Voting Copy February 2013\nand flowrates, workers look through the control room window to judge the process perfor-\nmance by the appearance (volume, color, and motion) of the flames that the process gases\ncreate when they exit the furnace and auto-ignite on contact with the room air. Cooling wa-\nter exits the hollow furnace cover sections and returns to a trough before being recirculated.\nMolten calcium carbide exits the EAF at about 3800°F through the drain holes in the sidewall\nof the furnace. The operator uses a motorized train system to move a deep tray on wheels,\ncalled a chill mold, to a hole position and an electric arc device to tap a drain hole through\nthe solidified calcium carbide and other materials that plug the hole in the side of the furnace.\nThe molten calcium carbide inside the furnace then drains from the tap hole into the chill\nmold. After filling multiple chill molds, the calcium carbide in that section of the furnace is\ndrained, and the flow from the tap hole slows significantly. Operators then plug the hole with\na mixture similar to mud and clay and move to tap the next location. Downstream units on-\nsite dump the chill molds, grind and screen the calcium carbide, and package the product.\nThe calcium carbide remains in the molds until it cools to about 500°F.\nU.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) investigators interviewed Carbide Industries personnel\nregarding difficulties in operating the process. In addition to incidents of cooling water leak-\ning from the furnace cover into the furnace, workers described instances of excess pressure\ndeveloping in the furnace. They called these excess pressure incidents “blows” because the\nexcess pressure would blow hot gases, and sometimes coke and lime feed material, out of\nthe furnace onto the second floor of the building. These blows occurred in the furnace a few\ntimes per year. After a furnace blow, the operators would remove the ejected material and\nrestart the furnace. The effects of water leaks varied from no noticeable impacts to potential\neffects such as bridging,5 which ultimately led to blows. The CSB could not find, nor did\nCarbide provide in response to requests, any documentation to indicate that these incidents or\n“blows” were investigated to determine their root cause. However, accident/incident investi-\ngations were completed when injuries not specifically related to the furnace “blows” occurred.\nFor example, one accident/incident investigation report provided by Carbide indicated that\nthe tap hole “blew hot carbide” causing burns to an employee.\n3.0 EMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\n3.1. COMMUNITY NOTIFICATION\nThe Rubbertown community includes homes and industrial facilities in close proximity,\nand in 2002, the Rubbertown Community Awareness Line (RCALL) notification system\nwas established to alert residents of all natural and manmade disasters. For incidents at the\nsurrounding industrial facilities, a company representative was responsible for calling into\nthe RCALL system to leave a message for the public. In addition, emergency responders\nsounded a siren that prompted residents to call the RCALL system to hear the message\nfrom the company representative.\n5Bridging, also called arching, is the formation of a hollow cavity under a pile of solids that would otherwise flow downward under the force of\ngravity. The hollow cavity forms due to the cohesiveness of the particles, which prevents flow and can be formed due to the presence of water or\ninsufficient mixing of fine particles in the feed.\nCSB • Carbide Industries Case Study 6\nCarbide Industries Case Study Board Voting Copy February 2013\n3.2. TRAINING FOR EMERGENCY RESPONDERS\nCarbide Industries trained some of its workers to act as on-site emergency responders and\nto provide general awareness training for contractors. The company also trained the Lake\nDreamland6 Fire Department for occasions where they might be needed to respond to\nincidents at the facility.\nThe training materials included a slide presentation and a video that focus on furnace area\nhazards such as:\n• Large amounts of electrical energy\n• Extremely hot substances and surfaces\n• Potential for high concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO gas)\n• Calcium oxide (lime)\nIn 2006, Carbide Industries and the Lake Dreamland Fire Department collaborated to\nproduce the training video “Carbide Industries LLC Fire Control Video.” The video shows\nLake Dreamland Firefighters responding to calcium carbide acetylene fires in a controlled\nsituation with Carbide personnel observing. The video narrator describes the hazards and\nissues involved in extinguishing calcium carbide acetylene fires. However, neither the slide\nshow nor the video provide detailed information on the hazards of contacting chemicals\nsuch as calcium carbide or calcium hydroxide on site.\n4.0 INCIDENT DESCRIPTION\nAt about 5:40 pm on Monday, March 21, 2011, the EAF at the Carbide Rubbertown\nfacility violently overpressured, ejecting solid and powdered debris, hot gases, and molten\ncalcium carbide at temperatures near 3800°F (2100°C). Witnesses reported an initial\noverpressure event from the furnace, a large explosion, and two to three more overpres-\nsure events. The cloud of debris and smoke traveled high enough to obscure the five-story\nfurnace building (Figure 4).\nThe hot gases and debris blown from the furnace broke through the double-pane reinforced\nglass window of the control room, severely burning the two workers inside; they died\nwithin 24 hours from their injuries.\nHot material also was ejected from the active tap hole on the mezzanine level. One worker\nwas in an operating shack about 30 feet from the tap hole. The door to the shack was ajar,\nand he crouched to the floor, seeking shelter from the hot gases and dust that engulfed\nhim. He received a minor burn to the back of his neck, but did not seek medical treatment.\nAnother worker was walking away from the furnace when the explosion knocked him to\nthe ground and the hot gases and debris engulfed him. He was taken to a maintenance area,\nwhere he was given oxygen and his vital signs monitored. He was later taken to the hospital\nfor observation and subsequently released.\n4.1. EMERGENCY RESPONSE\nCarbide Industries Safety, Health and Environmental (SH&E) Manager and members of the\nCarbide emergency response team helped evacuate the two workers from the control room,\nprovided oxygen, and monitored vital signs.\n6The Lake Dreamland Fire District, located in southwestern Jefferson County, includes residential and commercial areas in addition to industrial facilities.\nCSB • Carbide Industries Case Study 7\nCarbide Industries Case Study Board Voting Copy February 2013\nFIGURE 4 (LEFT)\nCloud of debris and\nsmoke obscures the five-\nstory furnace building\n(Photo courtesy Lake\nDreamland FD)\nFIGURE 5 (RIGHT)\nSecond floor of the Incident command was established about two minutes after the event occurred. An Assistant\nEAF building after the\nFire Chief of the Lake Dreamland Fire Department was driving by at the time of the incident\nexplosion\nand immediately responded by assuming the role of Incident Commander (IC) and activating\nresponse based on National Incident Management System (NIMS)7,8 protocols.9\nBecause of concerns of possible product contamination and the unknown conditions of\nthe immediate location of the incident, the incident commander established a staging area\nabout one-half mile upwind from the facility and a command post at the front gate and\ncalled ambulances to the staging area. The first ambulance was dispatched at 5:40 pm with\ntwo more dispatched shortly thereafter and arrived on scene within 15 minutes.\nCarbide personnel and Lake Dreamland Firefighters transported the injured employees to\nthe main gate where they met emergency medical technicians (EMTs). The fire department\ndecontaminated the injured employees with water while the Carbide emergency response\nteam and a fire department paramedic provided oxygen and monitored vital signs. One\nvictim went into cardiac arrest, and the paramedic began performing CPR on him. About\n40 minutes after the initial incident, off-site EMS began transporting victims to the hospital.\nThese victims arrived at the hospital about 12 minutes later, and succumbed to their injuries\nin less than 24 hours. A third ambulance transported the injured worker who had been\nknocked to the ground and injured by the blast.\n5.0 ANALYSIS\n5.1. PHYSICAL CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT\nThe CSB was unable to determine the exact cause of the March 21 incident, but several\nplausible scenarios were developed through a review of plant records, interviews with em-\nployees, and reconstruction based on known characteristics of the calcium carbide process.\n7 The Department of Homeland Security established the National Incident Management System as a uniform, scalable template to enable governments,\nnongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and the private sector to work together to prevent, protect against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate the\neffects of incidents.\n8The community notification system in effect on the day of the incident was the Rubbertown Community Action Line (RCALL) system. Carbide personnel\nwere focused on the victim rescue efforts and no one left information on the RCALL line for residents in the surrounding community. Because RCALL was\nthe information conduit, the community had no updates on the incident for 90 minutes following the explosion.\n9Lake Dreamland Fire Department’s jurisdiction includes 17 industrial and chemical facilities, and the incident commander reported being familiar with\nall of them through previous response efforts at those facilities. Lake Dreamland, Pleasure Ridge, and Dixie Suburban Fire Departments all responded\nto the incident.\nCSB • Carbide Industries Case Study 8\nCarbide Industries Case Study Board Voting Copy February 2013\nFIGURE 6\nDiagram of the furnace\ncover showing areas of\nrecent recurring water\nleaks\nExamination of the underside of the furnace cover revealed that much of the refractory lining\nwas worn and identified holes where cooling water had leaked into the furnace. Figure 6 is a\ndiagram of the furnace cover showing recent recurring water leaks in water cooling zones.\nThe CSB considered several possible mechanisms that led to the tragic incident. Leaks begin\ndue to thinning of the refractory lining, fouling,10 and the accumulation of solids inside the\nhollow chamber where water flows. Because the fouling insulates the metal on the under-\nside of the furnace cover from the cooling water, the high temperature of the furnace\nsoftens the metal and the metal sags under its own weight (Figure 7). With continued exposure\nto the furnace temperatures, the sagging bulge cracks open, which led to the formation of a leak\n(Figures 7 and 8).\nAnother possible cause of leaks is the sudden eruption of hot liquid from the furnace, which the\noperators call a boil-up. Repeated boil-ups of hot material from the furnace can cause a water\nleak by contacting the underside of the furnace cover, eroding its ceramic lining, and eventually\nmelting a hole in the metal furnace cover causing a water leak.\nThe presence of electric current requires that the furnace be shut down for workers to climb\nonto the furnace cover and repair water leaks. Carbide personnel described how they repair\nsmall holes by adding a mixture of oats and boiler solder, a commercially available powder used\nto repair leaks in steam boilers, to the cooling water. The cooling water flow pushes this mate-\nrial to the leak, and as the water evaporates at the leak point, the oats and boiler solder form\na plug. Carbide repairs larger leaks by welding metal plates on the inside of the hollow cavity\nthrough which the water flows to patch the hole; while this method prevents water from leaking\n10Fouling is the accumulation of unwanted material on solid surfaces and decreases function. The fouling material can consist of either living organisms\n(biofouling) or a non-living substance (inorganic or organic). Fouling usually occurs on a surface of a component, system or plant performing a defined\nand useful function, and the fouling process impedes or interferes with this function.\nCSB • Carbide Industries Case Study 9\nCarbide Industries Case Study Board Voting Copy February 2013\nFIGURE 7 (LEFT)\nCrack in furnace cover\nformed due to fouling\nFIGURE 8 (RIGHT)\nCooling water leak\nin furnace cover with\nceramic lining worn\naway\ninto the furnace, it leaves a lower layer of uncooled metal hanging beneath the now patched\nfurnace cover. Maintenance records obtained by the CSB indicated 26 work orders to repair\nfurnace cover water leaks in the four months prior to the March 2011 incident.\nAs early as 1965, a publication by an EAF expert, G.W. Healy describes a similar sequence of\noverpressure events in calcium carbide furnaces and notes that fine particles in the feed material\ncan possibly cause arching, even in the absence of water, and that insufficient mixing of the feed\ncan cause the liquid to overheat. Healy also calculated that the temperature required to start\nan undesirable side reaction between calcium carbide and calcium oxide could be reached in as\nlittle as one minute after the feed arches.\nHis calculations recognized that the reaction between calcium carbide and calcium oxide\ngenerates gas two and a half times as fast as the normal calcium carbide-forming reaction.\nIndependent analysis performed for the CSB indicated that, based on the operating data from\nCarbide, operating conditions on the day of the incident would have generated sufficient energy\nto emit hot materials from inside the furnace.\n5.2. NORMALIZATION OF DEVIANCE\n5.2.1. Carbide Industries\nThe Carbide Industries facility has operated for over 30 years, and had a history of low con-\nsequence incidents in the furnace. The CSB interviews with operators indicated that smaller\noverpressure incidents (“blows”) occurred in the furnace for the last 20 years. In 1991 a large\noverpressure incident blew in the window to the control room; Carbide replaced the window\nglass with reinforced glass, which was damaged by a similar incident in 2004. After the 2004\nincident, Carbide replaced the single pane reinforced glass with double pane reinforced glass,\nwhich was blown in by the March 2011 incident and which directly contributed to the fatal\nthermal injuries. Despite these previous incidents, Carbide’s response to the previous incidents\ndid not sufficiently address the hazard nor prevent the events from escalating.\nThe CSB requested investigation reports for the 1991 and 2004 incidents and engineering\nanalyses for the modifications to the window, but Carbide was unable to provide any analyses,\nmeeting summaries, or other documentation. Without a proper investigation of the incident,\nCarbide could not address the root causes to prevent future incidents, nor could the company\nperform a detailed hazard analysis that could have identified other potential incident scenarios.\nBy failing to analyze these incidents further, Carbide did not identify and address the potential\nfor even higher consequence incidents. Such an analysis would have likely identified the need to\nrelocate the control room and install video cameras to monitor furnace operations. This would\neliminate the need for a window and reduce personnel exposure to heat and overpressures\nproduced by a furnace blow.\nCSB • Carbide Industries Case Study 10\nCarbide Industries Case Study Board Voting Copy February 2013\nFurthermore, because Carbide did not thoroughly determine the root causes of the blows\nand eliminate them, the occurrence became normalized in the day-to-day operations of the\nfacility, including a blow which occurred earlier during a shift on the day of the incident.\nThis deficient approach to managing a process is termed by Diane Vaughn as, “normalization\nof deviance,” and is defined as the gradual shift in what is regarded as normal after repeated\nexposures to “deviant behavior.” In this instance, the behavior was a tolerance to what\nshould have been abnormal events (the blows). The result was a new normal, in which a\nboom occurring in the furnace was routine.\nThe CSB interviews verified that furnace blows were considered normal, as was revealed in the\nfollowing information obtained during an interview with a Carbide employee:\nAbout 5:00 o’clock … we heard the – heard the furnace – you know – do a little booming –\nyou know. And I didn’t think much – much of it, just the sound of it and stuff – you know.\nIt – it sounded normal when it does it. And then, it was just a little while after that, it went\noff again, and it was – it wasn’t normal.\nPast Carbide incident investigations indicate that injuries occurred due to handling raw materi-\nals, tapping holes, and blowing out lines at the furnace. These incidents speak to the hazards\nassociated with the process of producing calcium carbide and further emphasize the need for\nadditional analysis to determine the root causes.\nNormalization of deviance played a role in other major accidents investigated by the CSB such\nas the explosion at the BP refinery in Texas City, TX; the Imperial Sugar dust explosion in Port\nWentworth, GA; and the fatal phosgene leak at the DuPont plant in Belle, WV. In spite of past\nwarnings from alarms, near-misses, or lower severity incidents, each of these companies failed to\ncontrol a hazard, and a high severity incident occurred later.\n5.3. CODES AND STANDARDS\n5.3.1. NFPA 86 Standard for Ovens and Furnaces\nThe stated mission of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) is to reduce the\nworldwide burden of fire and other hazards on the quality of life by providing and advocat-\ning consensus codes and standards, research, training, and education. NFPA 86, Standard\nfor Ovens and Furnaces, an industry consensus standard, applies to facilities with ovens\nand furnaces. The majority of the standard applies to new or significantly modified con-\nstruction, when the authority having jurisdiction adopts the standard into state or local\ncodes, such as building codes and fire prevention codes.\nAccording to Section 3.3.25.3 of NFPA 86, Standard for Ovens and Furnaces (2011 ed.) a Class\nA furnace is, “An oven or furnace that has heat utilization equipment wherein there is a poten-\ntial explosion or fire hazard that could be occasioned by the presence of flammable volatiles or\ncombustible materials processed or heated in the furnace.” A Class B furnace is defined in the\nsame standard as, “An oven or furnace that has heat utilization equipment wherein there are no\nflammable volatiles or combustible materials being heated.”\nWhile most EAFs are used for melting metals, and therefore are considered Class B furnaces,\nsome products such as calcium carbide and ferrosilicon are produced in EAF processes that\ncontain flammable gases and low oxygen atmospheres.\nThe furnace involved in the March 21 incident is considered by definition a Class A furnace\nbecause it collects and vents flammable gases in a low oxygen environment that are a by-\nproduct of the chemical reactions that produce calcium carbide. Because NFPA 86 is silent\non coverage for EAFs operating as Class A furnaces, there are no operational requirements\nCSB • Carbide Industries Case Study 11\nCarbide Industries Case Study Board Voting Copy February 2013\nspecifically directed to Class A EAFs for provisions such as safety devices, interlocks, and\nsafe distances to occupied work areas.\nThe NFPA 86 Section 11.7.1 for Class A furnaces includes specific requirements for operating\n“Low Oxygen Atmosphere Class A Ovens with Solvent Recovery.” The requirements contain\nspecifications to ensure safe operation by urging:\n• Oven design that accommodates safe operating procedures (avoiding flammable atmospheres,\npurging with inert gas before start-up, shutdown procedures to avoid the flammable region of\nthe solvent, and emergency shutdown procedures);\n• Oven construction and location that minimizes the exposure of people to possible injury from\nfire, explosion and hazardous materials, as found in the General Chapter, Chapter 5, Section\n5.1.1.1 and 5.1.3;\n• Inert gas generation and storage, including compliance with ASME standard B31.3, and\nSection 11.7.8;\n• Continuous oxygen monitoring and control by inert gas addition as found in Section 11.7.2.\n5.3.2. KENTUCKY STANDARDS OF SAFETY\nKentucky Statute Section 227.300 created rules and regulations known as the “Standards of\nSafety,” which established requirements for design and construction of various facilities,\nincluding facilities with Class A furnaces. The State Fire Marshal is considered the authority\nhaving jurisdiction to enforce the standards, including approving new construction permits\nand conducting inspections.\nWhen Carbide Industries installed the EAF in 1968, adherence to NFPA 86 (1950 ed.) was\nrequired by the Kentucky Standards of Safety.11 The 1950 NFPA 86 definition of the Class A\novens and furnaces was similar to the definition in the current (2011) edition, but included\nan exclusion based on temperature, which the 1982 version eliminated.\n5.4. FACILITY SITING\nIn 1968, Carbide Industries installed the furnace 12 feet from the control room that served as\na workstation for one employee continuously for each shift. As a result of the 2011 explosion,\ntwo employees in the control room at the time of the incident died from injuries sustained in\nthe blast. Their injuries are attributed to their proximity to the furnace, and by the blast and\nthermal heat transfer when the incident occurred. The state fire prevention code, the Kentucky\nStandards of Safety (Section 4.5.4), required conformance to NFPA 86 at the time of furnace\nrebuild in 1982. The 2011 edition of NFPA 86, Standard for Ovens and Furnaces, lists the\nfollowing requirements in Chapter 5, “Location and Construction”:\nFurnaces and related equipment shall be located so as to protect personnel and buildings\nfrom fire or explosion hazards.\nHowever, NFPA 86 does not provide specific requirements on determining the distances between\noccupied areas and processes capable of producing a fire, explosion or an overpressure event\nwithin the same building or enclosure.\nThe CSB has noted the issue of siting hazardous processes near occupied areas in several\nof its investigations, including BP in Texas City, TX; Veolia Environmental Services in\nCarrollton, OH; First Chemical Corporation in Pascagoula, MS; and Sterigenics, Inc. in\n11Kentucky Statute Section 227.300 established rules and regulations known as the “Standards of Safety.” The 1955 version, in effect at the time of the\n1968 Carbide furnace construction, required conformance to the 1950 edition of NFPA 86, Standard for Class A Ovens and Furnaces.\nCSB • Carbide Industries Case Study 12\nCarbide Industries Case Study Board Voting Copy February 2013\nOntario, CA. In addition to the CSB, the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the Center\nfor Chemical Process Safety (CCPS) have provided guidance for the proper siting of buildings\nnear process units. NFPA codes, such as NFPA 30 and adopted building and fire codes, include\nconsiderations for location and construction of occupied areas near processes but do not give\nspecified distances or a quantitative process for determining how far a control room, labo-\nratory, lunch area, or office should be located from a furnace, vessel, or chemical process with\nthe potential for a fire or explosion. Little guidance exists in the public domain for the location\nof occupied areas within the same building or enclosure as a chemical process with deflagration\nor explosion potential.\n5.5. REGULATORY OVERSIGHT\n5.5.1. U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)\nThe Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 (PSM), is an OSHA-enforceable\nregulation for processes that contain highly hazardous materials or significant quantities of\nflammables. The intent of PSM, as stated in the standard, is for “preventing or minimizing the\nconsequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.\nThese releases may result in toxic, fire or explosion hazards.” PSM applies to processes using or\nproducing any of the 137 listed toxic chemicals at or above threshold quantities and processes\nwith flammable liquids or gases onsite in quantities of 10,000 pounds or more in one location.\nThe EAF process at Carbide Industries did not contain chemicals in large enough quantity to\nbe regulated by OSHA PSM. However, if applied to the Carbide Industries process, elements of\nPSM such as incident investigation, mechanical integrity, and training would have required prac-\ntices and procedures that could have prevented or lessened the consequences of the explosion.\nCarbide Industries had scheduled to replace the furnace cover in May 2011, but the new\ncover was incomplete at the time of the explosion—it had been fabricated and was waiting\nfor refractory lining. More important is that Carbide failed to implement a mechanical\nintegrity program as would have been required under the PSM standard if it had applied;\nthus the company lacked a program to ensure the timely replacement of the furnace cover\nprior to failure. If Carbide had adhered to the standard, it could have systematically tracked\nthe maintenance of the cover over time and predicted its safe service life.\nThe Kentucky Labor Cabinet proposed penalties of $72,800.00 as a result of this incident. The\nCarbide facility received two citations—one willful, and one serious. As this case study went to\npublication, all penalties were being contested by Carbide, and the citations were unresolved.\nThe citations alleged that employees worked in close proximity to electric arc furnaces that were\nnot operated with a robust inspection and preventive maintenance program exposing them to\nserious or fatal injuries. The citations alleged that Carbide had knowledge of the hazards of\nfurnace explosions and fires as documented in the plant’s 1998 Emergency Response Plan. The\nfacility was also cited because emergency response team members allegedly had not received\ntraining with respect to response procedures for furnace explosions.\n6.0 KEY FINDINGS\nDuring the investigation of the events at the Carbide Industries facility, the CSB found:\n1. The force of an explosion in the EAF broke the reinforced control room window, killing\ntwo workers.\n2. Previous furnace overpressure events had broken the control room window but had not\ncaused fatalities.\nCSB • Carbide Industries Case Study 13\nCarbide Industries Case Study Board Voting Copy February 2013\n3. Despite past incidents, neither the previous owners nor Carbide Industries identified that\nthe control room should be relocated and cameras installed to better protect workers while\nthey remotely monitored the furnace.\n4. Carbide Industries issued 26 work orders for leak repair for water leaks on the furnace cover\nin the five months prior to the March 2011 incident, but continued operating the furnace\ndespite the hazard from ongoing water leaks.\n5. T he company did not adequately address past explosive incidents, which normalized blows as\nroutine events.\n6. Carbide Industries had a new furnace cover built, which was waiting for refractory lining at\nthe time of the incident.\n7. The company did not have a process safety management program in place that required the\nelimination of overpressure incidents in the furnace.\n8. NFPA 86 does not specify safety requirements for electric arc furnaces operating as Class A\nfurnaces such as the one at Carbide Industries.\n7.0 RECOMMENDATIONS\n7.1. NATIONAL FIRE PROTECTION ASSOCIATION\n2011-5-I-KY-R1 Establish a committee to evaluate and develop a standard that defines\nthe safety requirements for electric arc furnaces operated with flamma-\nble materials and low oxygen atmospheres. At a minimum, establish\nrequirements that electric arc furnaces containing flammables have:\n• Adequate safety instrumentation and controls to prevent\nexplosions and overpressure events;\n• Mechanical integrity and inspection programs;\n• A documented siting analysis to ensure that control rooms\nand other occupied areas are adequately protected.\n7.2. CARBIDE INDUSTRIES\n2011-5-I-KY-R2 Modify the design and procedures for the electric arc furnace and re-\nlated structures including the control room to comply with the NFPA\nstandard developed per R1 of this case study.\n2011-5-I-KY-R3 Implement a mechanical integrity program for the electric arc furnace\nand cover, including preventive maintenance based on periodic inspec-\ntions, and timely replacement of the furnace cover. At a minimum, the\nprogram should include factors such as leak detection and repair and\nrefractory lining wear.\nCSB • Carbide Industries Case Study 14\nCarbide Industries Case Study Board Voting Copy February 2013\n8.0 REFERENCES\nAmerican Petroleum Institute (API).

Summary\nOn Tuesday, April 2, 2019, at 10:51 a.m., a flammable isobutylene vapor cloud exploded at the KMCO, LLC\n(“KMCO” pronounced “chem-co”) facility in Crosby, Texas. The event fatally injured one KMCO employee\nand seriously injured two others. At least 28 other workers were injured, including five KMCO employees and\n23 contract workers. On the day of the incident, more than 200 people were onsite, including KMCO\nemployees, contract workers, and visitors. At approximately 11:00 a.m., local authorities issued a shelter-in-\nplace order to residents within a 1-mile radius that was lifted over four hours later at approximately 3:15 p.m.\nThe incident occurred while KMCO operations staff were making a batch of sulfurized isobutylene, a\nlubrication additive product.a At 10:41 a.m., a fist-sized piece of metal broke away from the body of a 3-inch\ncast iron y-strainer in the batch reactor’s liquid isobutylene supply piping. The field operator (who was a trainee\nat the time) was walking nearby and immediately stopped after hearing the loud noise created when the y-\nstrainer broke. After a brief communication with a contract insulator who was exiting the area, the field operator\ncontacted his board operator, beginning a series of urgent communications and quick actions by KMCO’s\noperators and operations supervisors to stop the flammable isobutylene release, move other workers away from\nthe danger, and prevent the vapor cloud from igniting.\nKMCO’s operations staff succeeded in moving other workers out of the immediate area and preventing vehicle\ntraffic from approaching the flammable vapor cloud. Operations team members entered the release area and\nmanually closed valves. This stopped the flow of isobutylene, but more than 10,000 pounds had already been\nreleased. The operations team members also opened other valves, allowing firewater to spray throughout the\nbatch reactor area.\nThese actions were mostly complete when the isobutylene vapor cloud suddenly exploded while two operators\nwere still within the vapor cloud, and a shift supervisor was near it. The explosion fatally injured one of the\noperators; the other operator and the shift supervisor suffered serious burn injuries.\nPortions of the KMCO facility were substantially damaged from the explosion and subsequent fires. News\noutlets reported that the explosion shook nearby homes and was heard throughout the surrounding community.b\nKMCO filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy (liquidation) in May 2020, and the facility was sold to Altivia Oxide\nChemicals, LLC (“Altivia”). In July 2020, Altivia informed the CSB that it planned to dismantle KMCO’s\nsulfurized isobutylene equipment involved in the incident as part of the company’s efforts to install and operate\nnew oxide reaction equipment at the Crosby, Texas, facility.\na KMCO’s sulfurized isobutylene process described in this report was covered by OSHA’s Process Safety Management (PSM) standard\nand the EPA’s Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.\nb See ABC News: Deadly Chemical Explosion [93, 9], and KHOU 11 News: Residents Heard, Felt Deadly Crosby Plant Explosion From\nMiles Away [94].\nPage 8\nInvestigation Report\nSafety Issues\nThe CSB’s investigation identified the safety issues below.\n1. Emergency Response. KMCO’s emergency response procedures and training did not properly limit the\nrole of its operators during the emergency response. KMCO’s plant culture relied on unit operators taking\nquick actions to stop a release before the site’s emergency response team assembled. KMCO could have\nreduced the severity of the April 2, 2019, event by establishing clear policies and training its workforce not\nto put themselves in danger to urgently stop a chemical release. The Occupational Safety and Health\nAdministration’s (OSHA) Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response standard, more\ncommonly referred to as HAZWOPER, provides the minimum requirements for emergency response\noperations involving hazardous materials, such as isobutylene. Effective emergency response operations\nprioritize life safety. Emergency response procedures and training should clearly communicate which\nincidents plant operators should respond to and which should be handled by a more qualified emergency\nresponse team. (See Section 4.1)\n2. Remote Isolation. When the y-strainer ruptured, KMCO’s workers lacked the safety equipment they\nneeded to stop (isolate) the isobutylene release from a safe location, such as from within the blast-resistant\ncontrol room. For example, had KMCO workers been able to close the actuated block valve installed just\nupstream of the y-strainer from the control room, the amount of isobutylene released and the subsequent\nharm to workers could have been greatly reduced. Industry knowledge about the need to provide workers\nwith the capability to remotely isolate a major leak from a safe location dates back to at least 1969—50\nyears before the isobutylene vapor cloud explosion at KMCO. In fact, KMCO had an existing\nrecommendation from a 2010 report developed for insurance underwriting purposes that called for\nproviding remote isolation equipment for certain flammable liquid systems, including isobutylene.\nAlthough KMCO had installed remote isolation equipment for some of these systems, the company had not\nyet addressed this recommendation for its isobutylene system. (See Section 4.2)\n3. Hazard Evaluation. Hazard evaluation is one of the most important elements of a process safety\nmanagement program. KMCO’s hazard evaluations consistently overlooked or misunderstood that its y-\nstrainer was made from cast iron, a brittle material that existing industry standards and good practice\nguidance documents either prohibit or warn against using in hazardous applications, such as KMCO’s\nisobutylene system. In addition, none of KMCO’s hazard evaluations identified the potential for liquid\nthermal expansion or other possible scenarios to develop high-pressure conditions within the piping system\nthat included the y-strainer. As a result, unlike other portions of KMCO’s isobutylene piping, this piping\nsection was not equipped with a pressure-relief device or otherwise protected from potential high-pressure\nconditions. (See Section 4.3)\nPage 9\nInvestigation Report\nCause\nThe CSB determined that the cause of the isobutylene release was a brittle overload fracture of the cast iron y-\nstrainer driven by internal pressure. The y-strainer was installed in a segment of the isobutylene piping that was\nnot protected from the high-pressure conditions that developed within this equipment, most likely from liquid\nthermal expansion. The isobutylene vapor cloud was most likely ignited by electrical equipment within a poorly\nsealed, nearby building.\nKMCO’s hazard evaluation programs, including process hazard analysis, pre-startup safety review, and\nmanagement of change, also contributed to the incident. KMCO’s hazard evaluations consistently overlooked or\nmisunderstood that its y-strainer was made from cast iron, a brittle material that existing industry standards and\ngood practice guidance documents either prohibit or warn against using in hazardous applications, such as the\ncompany’s isobutylene system. In addition, none of KMCO’s hazard evaluations identified the potential for\nliquid thermal expansion or other possible scenarios to develop high-pressure conditions within the piping\nsystem that included the y-strainer. As a result, unlike other portions of KMCO’s isobutylene piping, this piping\nsection was not equipped with a pressure-relief device to protect it from potential high-pressure conditions.\nKMCO did not provide safety equipment that its workers could have used to remotely stop (isolate) the\nisobutylene release from a safe location, which contributed to the severity of the incident. Deficiencies in\nKMCO’s emergency response system, including its procedures and training, also contributed to the severity of\nthe incident by not effectively distinguishing which events its operators should handle from those incidents that\nthe site’s emergency response team must respond to. Because KMCO relied on its unit operators to take quick\nactions to stop chemical releases, workers who were in a safe location moved toward the flammable isobutylene\nvapor cloud, which put them in harm’s way. KMCO could have reduced the severity of the event by establishing\nclear policies and training its workforce to respond to a chemical release without putting themselves in harm’s\nway.\nRecommendations\nFollowing its April 2, 2019, incident, KMCO filed for bankruptcy, and the company is no longer in business.\nAltivia Oxide Chemicals, LLC (Altivia) purchased the Crosby, Texas, facility in 2020 and informed the CSB\nthat the process involved in the incident would be dismantled as part of Altivia’s efforts to install two new oxide\nreactors and start production by the end of 2020. As a result, the CSB is not issuing recommendations with this\nreport.\nNevertheless, the CSB urges Altivia to read this report closely and understand the factors that led to the incident\nat the KMCO facility and the lessons stemming from it. Moreover, if hereafter Altivia reinitiates the process or\nany equipment involved in this incident, the company should ensure that the facts, conditions, and circumstances\nthat caused the incident—and contributed to its severity—are not repeated.\nPage 10\nInvestigation Report\n1 Background\nKMCO\nThe KMCO, LLC (“KMCO” pronounced “chem-co”) facility in Crosby, Texas, employed 164 people to\nmanufacture specialty chemicals and operate its tolling facilities (Figure 1) [1].a Tolling is an arrangement in\nwhich a company processes raw materials or semifinished goods for another company.”b KMCO purchased the\nCrosby plant on July 1, 2012, and invested over $50 million in the facility to, among other things, provide new\nequipment and infrastructure, including:c\n• Blast-resistant control room (Reaction Control Room);\n• Facility alarm system;d\n• Isobutylene storage tank and piping;\n• Distributed Control System (“Control System”);\n• Increased process automation;\n• Motor Control Center;\n• Two 350,000-gallon wastewater tanks;\n• Boiler and condensate system;\n• Firewater system;\n• Cooling tower; and\n• Plant air system.\na Artie McFerrin founded a company that built the plant at the Crosby site in 1975 [96]. In July 2012, the McFerrin family’s company\n(KMCO, LP) sold the plant to KMCO, LLC.\nb The Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS) defines tolling as “[p]roviding manufacturing services for a fee by a contractor (the\ntoller), to a company issuing (letting) a contract for those services. Tolled services can include, reaction processes, formulation,\nblending, mixing or size reduction, separation, agglomeration, packaging/repackaging, and others or a combination of the above” [86].\nc ORG Chemical Holdings, a private equity firm, was the parent owner of KMCO, LLC. ORG Chemical Holdings also owned the\nKMTEX, LLC (“KMTEX”), which operated a facility in Port Arthur, Texas. KMTEX was sold to Monument Chemical in July 2021\n[78]. Similar to KMCO, KMTEX was a tolling and specialty chemical manufacturing facility.\nd KMCO provided a news update about its new emergency alarm system on January 12, 2017 [87].\nPage 11\nInvestigation Report\nFigure 1. KMCO Facility in Crosby, Texas.a (Source: KMCO)\nIn June 2016, KMCO announced a new leadership team that, among other changes, sought to implement new\nmanagement systems to ensure “safe and compliant operations” [2]. At the time of the April 2, 2019, incident,\nmany of KMCO’s key leadership positions were held by people who had less than two years of experience with\nKMCO. These employees were hired to help KMCO improve the site’s management systems, and they were\nresponsible for much of the site’s process safety management program. The recently filled positions included the\nvice president of operations, plant manager, safety director, safety manager, emergency response team leader,\nsafety technician, maintenance manager, reliability engineer, maintenance engineer, operations manager, and\noperations engineer.\nKMCO Bankruptcy\nThe incident on April 2, 2019, interrupted normal business operations at KMCO and resulted in several rounds\nof employee layoffs that gradually decreased the number of employees at the Crosby facility over the next 13\nmonths. On May 8, 2020, KMCO filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code [3]. Under\nChapter 7 bankruptcy (liquidation), KMCO’s property was sold to provide money to individuals or companies to\nwhom KMCO owed money [4]. Court records show that KMCO agreed to sell its chemical manufacturing\nfacility in Crosby, Texas, to Altivia Oxide Chemicals, LLC, on the same day that KMCO filed for bankruptcy.\nThe bankruptcy court approved the sale on May 26, 2020 [3]. As a result of the April 2, 2019, incident, KMCO\nis no longer in business.\na Based on the equipment and buildings shown in this photo, this image was likely taken between 2015 and 2016.\nPage 12\nInvestigation Report\nIsobutylene\nIsobutylene is a highly flammable, colorless gas with a sweet gasoline odor [5].a Under certain (temperature and\npressure) conditions, isobutylene can be a liquid.b Among other things, isobutylene is used in the production of\naviation fuel, resins, chemicals, packaging, plastics, and antioxidants for food [5]. Isobutylene is typically\ntransported and stored in a liquefied form, and it is among the gases referred to as LPG, or liquefied petroleum\ngas [6].c KMCO received isobutylene shipments as a liquid, stored its isobutylene as a liquid, and fed the\nisobutylene to its batch reaction system as a liquid.\nIsobutylene System\nKMCO used isobutylene as a raw material in its batch reaction process (Figure 3) to manufacture sulfurized\nisobutylene lubrication additive products.d On the day of the incident, this reaction system (“unit”) was\nproducing HiTEC® 3315, a lubrication additive.\nThe equipment used to produce sulfurized isobutylene at KMCO included an isobutylene storage tanke and a\nbatch reactor (Figure 2).f This report uses the term “batch” because KMCO manufactured its sulfurized\nisobutylene products in batches rather than continuously.\na Isobutylene has a vapor density of 1.94, making it heavier than air. Isobutylene’s lower explosive limit is about 1.8 volume percent, and\nits upper explosive limit is about 9.6 volume percent. The flash point of isobutylene is -105 degrees Fahrenheit (℉) [77].\nb Isobutylene is a gas at atmospheric pressure and typical outdoor air temperatures. Liquefying isobutylene requires increasing the\npressure, significant cooling, or a combination of increasing pressure and cooling. At atmospheric pressure, isobutylene will be a liquid\nif it is colder than its boiling point of 19.6 ℉ [68]. Liquefying isobutylene at 20 degrees Celsius (68 ℉) requires pressures greater than\n2,560 hectopascal (37.1 pounds per square inch) [95, p. 8]. Liquefying isobutylene requires more pressure at warmer temperatures and\nless pressure at cooler temperatures.\nc Other LPGs include propane, propylene, and butane [92, p. 365].\nd Sulfurized isobutylene is an extreme pressure lubrication additive [84, p. 120].\ne KMCO’s 70,000-gallon isobutylene storage tank was built in 2014, and the tank was commissioned and began operating in 2015. The\ntank was made from SA-516-70 carbon steel, had an inner diameter of 12 feet, and was 80 feet long (seam-to-seam). The tank’s 2:1\nelliptical “heads” add to the overall length. The maximum allowable working pressure was 200 pounds per square inch at 150 ℉. The\nisobutylene storage tank was designed to meet the 2013 edition of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) code,\nSection VIII, Division 1.\nf KMCO replaced its isobutylene storage tank and piping system during 2014 and 2015. The primary reason for the new isobutylene\nsystem was to improve safety. The previous isobutylene storage tank was located within the unit, not far from the batch reactor. Safety\nconcerns about transferring isobutylene from trucks to the old isobutylene storage tank, which was near a hot oil heater, were among the\nreasons for installing the new isobutylene storage tank and piping system.\nPage 13\nInvestigation Report\nFigure 2. Post-Incident Photos of KMCO’s Isobutylene Storage Tank (left) and Batch Reactor System\n(right).

Isobutylene System. This simplified schematic shows the isobutylene system KMCO used to\nsupply (charge) its batch reactor. The red circle shows the location of the y-strainer. (Credit: CSB)\nThere were two pumps in the isobutylene system: an isobutylene circulation pump and an isobutylene charge\npump. The pumps were not operated remotely and could only be started or stopped by operators in the field.\nThe circulation pump provided a steady supply of isobutylene to help maintain the reliable operation of the\ncharge pump. The isobutylene circulation pump circulated isobutylene through more than 1,200 feet of piping\nfrom the storage tank to the batch reactor area and back to the isobutylene storage tank. The isobutylene charge\npump was used to charge the batch reactor when the batch reaction procedure called for adding isobutylene. As\nshown in Figure 3, KMCO installed a pressure-relief valve on the charge pump’s outlet piping. This pressure-\nrelief valve’s outlet (discharge) was typically routed to the charge pump’s inlet (suction piping). In addition, the\ninlet piping to the isobutylene charge pump included a filtration device commonly called a y-strainer (Figure 4).\nPage 15\nInvestigation Report\nFigure 4. Y-Strainer (East Side). This post-incident photo shows the top and east sides of the 3-\ninch y-strainer in the inlet piping to the isobutylene charge pump. The orientation of the y-\nstrainer was such that the straight-through flow was headed north. (Credit: CSB)\nIn addition to manually operated valves, the isobutylene system had several actuated valves. Of these actuated\nvalves, board operators working inside the control room could control only the pressure control valve shown in\nFigure 3. The actuated ball valves could only be opened or closed by operators in the field.a\nShift Operations Staffing\nKMCO used a single shift supervisor to oversee all shift operations activities.b Depending on the type of\noperation or reaction chemistry involved, KMCO strategically split its operations group into two major\ngroups—Reaction 1 and Reaction 2.c Reaction 1 included five operational areas, and Reaction 2 included two\noperational areas.\nIn the Reaction 2 area, the batch reactor system used to make sulfurized isobutylene was one of several\noperating units assigned to Board Operator 1. Board Operator 2 had a nearly equivalent level of responsibility\nfor other operating units. The Reaction 2 area had several field operators to support each of the two board\na The actuated ball valve on the inlet (suction) piping to the isobutylene circulation pump was equipped with a fusible link. This design\nshould allow the valve to automatically close under certain fire conditions [54, p. 97]. The April 2, 2019, incident did not expose this\nvalve to fire conditions.\nb Additional managers and supervisors were present to support the other work that occurs during the Monday through Friday day shifts.\nc Not all operations units under “Reactions” involved chemical reactions.\nPage 16\nInvestigation Report\noperators. One field operator supported the isobutylene system used to charge the sulfurized isobutylene\nreaction system. Board Operator 1 and Board Operator 2 conducted most of their work inside the Reaction\nControl Room, but each board operator also had some field responsibilities. For example, these board operators\nmight go outside to help a field operator or verify a proper valve alignment in the field before starting an\noperational activity.\nControl Room(s)\nThere were three buildings at KMCO that workers commonly referred to as “control rooms,” but at the time of\nthe April 2, 2019, incident, only one was being used as a formal control room (Figure 5).\nFigure 5. Reaction Control Room. KMCO’s blast-resistant control room. (Credit: CSB)\nFollowing a facility siting study, KMCO built a blast-resistant control room in 2013 to improve safety.a After its\ncompletion, KMCO relocated the shift supervisor and plant operators from the two previous control rooms—the\nReaction 1 Control Room and the Reaction 2 Control Room—to the new Reaction Control Room (Figure 6).\na Both the Baker Panel report and the CSB’s investigation of the 2005 BP America Refinery explosion in Texas City, Texas, discuss the\nimportance of using blast-resistant buildings [90, 91].\nPage 17\nInvestigation Report\nFigure 6. KMCO Control Rooms. This 2019 image of the KMCO facility shows the location of\nthe Reaction 1 Control Room (yellow “1”), the Reaction 2 Control Room (yellow “2”), the new\nReaction Control Room (purple “3”), and the location of the isobutylene release (yellow star).\n(Credit: Google, annotations by CSB)\nKMCO later converted the Reaction 1 Control Room to store personal protective equipment (PPE) and renamed\nthis plant building the PPE Room (Figure 7).\nPage 18\nInvestigation Report\nFigure 7. PPE Room. This photo shows the former Reaction 1 Control Room that KMCO converted\nto store PPE. The construction of the former Reaction 2 Control Room was similar to this building.\n(Credit: CSB)\nKMCO managers stated that the former Reaction 2 Control Room was “essentially an old electrical building”\nwith load cells, local process data readouts, and motor control equipment to start or stop some pumps. After\ncommissioning the new Reaction Control Room, KMCO renamed the former Reaction 2 Control Room the R-II\nMotor Control building (“R2 Building”). The R2 Building also housed the equipment needed to stop some of the\nequipment for Board Operator 2’s units. A self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) was also located in this\nbuilding.\nKMCO planned to relocate useful equipment from the R2 Building into a new motor control centera and then\ndemolish the R2 Building. KMCO’s decision to eliminate this building was based on safety concerns with the\nR2 Building’s type of construction and the proximity of this building to reactors, as well as more efficient\noperation. As one manager stated, “That’s a very old method of construction. You find it on chemical plants\neverywhere, and you want to move that out.”\nAltivia Oxide Chemicals\nAltivia Oxide Chemicals, LLC (“Altivia”) announced its purchase of KMCO’s Crosby, Texas, facility on June\n1, 2020 [7]. Altivia informed the CSB that it would not seek to operate the batch reactor and isobutylene system\ninvolved in the April 2, 2019, incident (Figure 3). Altivia further communicated that the process equipment\nKMCO used to manufacture sulfurized isobutylene lubrication additive products would be dismantled as part of\nAltivia’s efforts to install two new oxide reactors and start production by the end of 2020.b\na A motor control center is a physical grouping of motor starters in one assembly [69].\nb In addition, Altivia informed the CSB that it did not intend to conduct its own investigation or complete KMCO’s investigation of the\nApril 2, 2019, incident. KMCO’s investigation of the incident ended with its bankruptcy filing.\nPage 19\nInvestigation Report\nSurrounding Area Demographics\nFigure 8 shows the KMCO facility and depicts the surrounding area. The circles are set at one (blue), three\n(orange), and five (yellow) miles from the location of the isobutylene release.

Field\nOperator 1 and Board Operator 1 worked together to complete the isobutylene charge to the batch reactor that\nKMCO’s night shift operators had started. After completing the isobutylene charge, Field Operator 1 closed\nseveral valves on the isobutylene charge pump outlet (discharge) piping to the batch reactor. Control system\ndata showed that the isobutylene charge was completed at 6:25 a.m.a, b\nIsobutylene Release\nLater that morning, Board Operator 1 and Board Operator 2 were working in the Reaction Control Room.\nSurveillance video showed that the weather was calm and mostly clear, generally unfavorable for dispersing a\ngas release (Figure 9).c Shortly before 10:41 a.m.,d Field Operator 1 (who was a trainee at the time) was\nwalking by the sulfurized isobutylene batch reactor when he heard a loud “pop” sound followed by a loud\nwhooshing noise similar to “an air hose coming off.” Field Operator 1 told CSB investigators that a y-strainer\nfailed. He described the isobutylene release as “coming out quick.” A contract worker insulating tubing near the\nreactor heard the loud sound when the “line blew,” saw the vapor pouring into the area, and ran out of the unit.\nShe described the vapor as chest-high and growing larger, flowing down the adjacent road. The contract worker\nsaw Field Operator 1, told him that she did not know what had happened, and then evacuated from the area.\na A scrubber pump needed repair, and KMCO suspended the sulfurized isobutylene batch until that maintenance work was completed.\nWhile waiting for the maintenance on the scrubber pump, Field Operator 1 performed other tasks, such as helping a coworker connect a\nrailcar for a different process.\nb This report uses KMCO’s control system data as the basis for time. The CSB’s factual update for the KMCO incident used surveillance\nvideo as the basis for time. Based on the time of the explosion, the CSB estimates that 67 seconds need to be added to surveillance\nvideo time to match control system time. See the Timeline of Key Events (Appendix B) for more precise time stamps of certain events.\nc KMCO did not have weather station equipment to monitor or record weather conditions. Weather conditions are available for the\nGeorge Bush Intercontinental Airport, a straight-line distance of about 19 miles from KMCO. Five consecutive hourly weather records,\nfrom 5:53 a.m. through 9:53 a.m., show calm winds at the airport, with temperatures rising from 38 to 54 ℉ [72]. The 10:53 a.m. airport\nweather data shows a temperature of 59 ℉, variable wind direction, and a wind speed of three miles per hour [72]. The National\nWeather Service defines variable wind the same way as variable wind direction. Variable wind means that the wind direction fluctuates\nby 60 degrees or more during the 2-minute evaluation period and the wind speed is greater than six knots (6.9 miles per hour), or the\nwind direction is variable, and the wind speed is less than six knots [71].\nd KMCO control system data for the flow meter on the isobutylene circulation pump (Figure 3) shows a significant increase in\nisobutylene flow shortly before 10:41 a.m., consistent with a hole developing in the y-strainer, releasing isobutylene to the atmosphere.\nPage 22\nInvestigation Report\nFigure 9. Surveillance Video Images Showing the Time of Incident Weather Conditions at KMCO. The\nyellow circle (left) shows a windsock under calm wind conditions. (Credit: KMCO, annotation by CSB)\nField Operator 1 saw a white cloud of vapor hovering near the ground with three to four feet of a wavy, hazy\nvapor above it that looked “like a water mirage over hot pavement” or “like if you’re filling up a gas tank and\nyou see the fumes coming out.”\nOperations Response and the Explosion\nSince Field Operator 1 had only been with KMCO for about six months, he was not sure what material was\nbeing released; so he called Board Operator 1 to come out to the unit to help assess the situation. Field Operator\n1 met Board Operator 1 about halfway between the Reaction Control Room and the batch reactor. Board\nOperator 1 identified the leak as isobutylene and, using the all-calla feature on Field Operator 1’s radio, which\nallowed simultaneous communication on all the KMCO radio channels, announced: “Attention KMCO,\nevacuate the reaction area.” Based on KMCO’s surveillance video, which shows key people suddenly acting\nwith concern and purpose, this radio call to evacuate the reaction area took place shortly after 10:45 a.m.\nField Operator 1 and Board Operator 1 then retreated to the Reaction Control Room. Board Operator 1 put an\nSCBA on for respiratory protection, took a radio from Field Operator 1, and headed back to the unit. Soon after\n10:46 a.m., the isobutylene release stopped after Board Operator 1 closed a manual isolation valve in the unit.b\nField Operator 1 then teamed up with a senior field operator to turn on firewater monitors, instruct people using\nmotorized equipment to shut the equipment down and evacuate, and close vehicle gates to prevent workers from\ndriving into the flammable vapor cloud.\nAt 10:46 a.m., KMCO’s Shift Supervisor was attending a meeting in the administration building, which was\nlocated about 300 feet from where the release had occurred.c The Shift Supervisor heard the radio call from\nBoard Operator 1 about the isobutylene release, immediately left the meeting, and headed toward the sulfurized\nisobutylene unit. Approaching the unit, the Shift Supervisor described seeing “a two-foot river” of isobutylene\na An all-call is a call from an individual radio to every radio on the channel and multiple talk groups. It is often used to make important\nannouncements [70, p. 14].\nb KMCO control system data shows the isobutylene flow started decreasing at 10:46:13 a.m. and stopped at 10:46:23 a.m. Due to the\nnature and extent of Board Operator 1’s injuries, the CSB was not able to interview Board Operator 1. Based on his experience and\nother actions he performed, the CSB concluded that Board Operator 1 was most likely the person who closed the isolation valve to stop\nthe isobutylene release.\nc At the time that the y-strainer ruptured, the Shift Supervisor was attending a meeting to discuss the findings of recent incident\ninvestigations at the facility and determine whether effective corrective actions were being developed.\nPage 23\nInvestigation Report\nvapor “going all the way down the road.”a Upon seeing the magnitude of the release, the Shift Supervisor used\nthe all-call feature on his radio to order an evacuation of the plant at about 10:47 a.m. At about this time, the\nShift Supervisor saw that Board Operator 1 and Board Operator 2 were responding to the isobutylene release\nand wearing SCBAs.\nThe Shift Supervisor turned on a nearby firewater monitor to direct water spray over a portion of the isobutylene\nvapor cloud, went into the boiler house, shut down the boiler, and told other workers in the area to evacuate. The\nShift Supervisor recalled seeing Board Operator 1 and Board Operator 2 turning firewater monitors on and\nactivating water deluge systems in their respective units. The Shift Supervisor said that Board Operator 1 had\nalso manually closed valves to stop the isobutylene release. The Shift Supervisor then went to another nearby\nfirewater monitor and turned it on. After turning on this last firewater monitor, the Shift Supervisor turned to\nleave the area, and the explosion occurred. KMCO surveillance cameras visibly shook after 10:51 a.m.,\ncapturing the time of the explosion. The explosion lifted the Shift Supervisor off the ground. Upon landing, the\nShift Supervisor was surrounded by flames and suffered serious burns. When the flames receded, the Shift\nSupervisor was able to get up and walk to the plant gate, where another KMCO supervisor helped him get\nmedical attention for his burn injuries.\nA KMCO manager, who had gone toward the unit following Board Operator 1’s radio call at 10:46 a.m.,\nwitnessed Board Operator 1 completing some activity near the batch reactor. The manager could not tell\nwhether Board Operator 1 was in the vapor cloud, but the isobutylene vapor cloud was between them. The\nmanager described the vapor cloud as being “knee to … waist-high” and added that “it was rolling.” “Not\nrolling as moving forward but rolling within itself … .” The manager described what happened next. He said:\nSo, when I saw [the vapor cloud] … I yelled at [Board Operator 1], motioning him to\ncome on, it’s time to come out. I was about 20 yards away, equipment stuff going on,\ndon’t know whether he heard me or not. But it appeared to me at that time that for\nwhatever [reason], if he heard me or not, that he was headed toward me in my direction.\nAs Board Operator 1 began exiting the unit, he was walking through the vapor cloud when it suddenly ignited,\nand Board Operator 1 was engulfed in a “ball of fire.” When the flames subsided, the manager helped Board\nOperator 1 exit the plant and get medical attention for his burn injuries.\nThe initial response to the emergency was handled by KMCO’s operators and operations management. These\nactivities included manually closing valves to stop (isolate) the isobutylene leak, activating firewater deluge\nsystems, ordering a plant-wide evacuation, turning off equipment, closing vehicle gates, instructing people using\nmotorized equipment to shut the equipment down and evacuate, and assisting the injured out of the plant to get\nmedical attention. The first member of KMCO’s emergency response team (ERT) to put on their protective\nequipment and head toward the unit did so at about 10:54 a.m., about three minutes after the explosion.\na The Shift Supervisor wore the normal plant-required personal protective equipment, including flame-resistant clothing, safety glasses, a\nhard hat, and safety shoes.\nPage 24\nInvestigation Report\nEmergency Notification and Evacuation\nAfter evacuating from the batch reactor area, the contract worker who was insulating tubing in the area where\nthe isobutylene release occurred warned her coworker about the emergency, hurried to her car, and drove away\nfrom the plant. She drove about three miles and stopped near a local restaurant to call her company. She\ndescribed hearing the explosion at KMCO as she was exiting her vehicle.\nOn the day of the incident, more than 200 KMCO employees, contract workers, and visitors were onsite. KMCO\nhad a plant alarm system that, among other purposes, was supposed to ensure all workers could be notified of\nemergency situations. But KMCO never activated its plant alarm system during the isobutylene release,\nexplosion, or subsequent fires. Instead, KMCO relied on its plant radio system to make emergency notifications.\nAt KMCO, most employees carried a radio. For contractors, it was typical to have the foreman carry a radio. For\na team of contract workers, one member of the team would normally have a radio. But not all workers at the site\ncarried a radio or were with someone carrying a radio. As a result, some workers did not receive the emergency\nnotification radio message to evacuate from the plant.\nWhile discussing which workers carried a radio, one contractor supervisor explained the normal practice and\nwhat he experienced on the day of the incident:\nI require all my teams to go out as teams, all my people to go out as teams of at least two.\nAnd each team is required to have a radio.\nI heard a call over the radio. “Evacuate the reaction area.” With a definite sense of\nurgency in their voice. Then seconds later, “Turn off the fans. Turn off the fans.” Seconds\nlater. Then they called for ERT. “We need ERT immediately.”\nSo, from that point, immediately after that, I jumped up out of my desk [chair], left the\noffice, went outside, and made a call on the radio, saying, … “All [name of contractor]\nemployees quickly but safely, please make your way back ... to the warehouse,” you\nknow. So I could get accountability for everybody that was here.\nShortly after that, … most everybody was in the warehouse at that point. So I could see\nthat people were here.\nWe got almost to the [motor control center] building here, and that’s when I saw the fire\nsuppression system and knew that this was a serious ... this was a serious something.\nSomething was really bad wrong. A, they’ve never called an evacuation while we were\nhere before. And, B, with the fire suppression going on in the reaction area, that was bad.\nThat was not going to be good. Seconds later was the first explosion.\nI ran back to my office grabbed my keys and my clipboard with my sign-in sheet. I also\nhave everyone that comes to work for me, subs, and engineers and … my field hands,\nthey all sign in on a sign-in sheet. That way, I have accountability for them every day.\nThat was my saving grace that morning. So I grabbed it, and I headed out as well. ... I\nwas the last one out. Made sure everyone else was out, and then I left. I met them over at\nPage 25\nInvestigation Report\nthe ... Everyone was over behind ... the [Emergency Response Team] building. So I got\na headcount. And not only did I get a headcount, but I checked off the names as I saw\nthem. I physically saw you, made you speak to me, and then I signed their names off.\nBut hearing the call on the plant radio system was not the signal all the contract workers relied upon to evacuate.\nA contract insulator, working in a different contractor’s crew with two other workers, was walking toward a job\nsite when his foreman suddenly stopped. The insulator described his experience, saying:\nThe foreman had a weird look on his face, looking towards the distance. And he was\ntelling us to, you know, ‘come here,’ you know, ‘Do you see what I see?’ And we all\nwent towards him, and we saw, towards the distance, the … the disorientation of the …\nof the air.\nAnd nobody told us anything. Nobody told us on the radio what … if anything was going\non. But if it wasn’t for him [the foreman], we wouldn’t have known. So that’s when we\njust took our own advice and said, this is a leak, you know, we should just walk out.\nAnybody that we see, we tell them to walk out.\nAnd there are two operators close to the leak, by the way. But they were discussing\nbetween themselves, as if they were in shock as well, but didn’t know how to react to it\n[…].\nAnd as we got to the gate … it was locked. … And right then and there we saw [the\nexplosion] … like a big ball of fire. And you could just feel the pressure hit you. And\nthat’s when everybody panicked, really. So everybody started running. I just followed the\ncrowd. And I don’t know what they were going to do at the gate, but they decided to pick\nit up (Figure 10). And I was one of the first ones to go and squeeze under there. I don’t\neven know how I managed to, but … you know, thank God that I … that I did. And, yeah,\nafter that, we just walked away as far as we could to get away from the … the explosion.\nPage 26\nInvestigation Report\nFigure 10. Evacuation Under Plant Fencing. This surveillance camera image shows workers\nhelping other workers to exit under plant fencing about 36 seconds after the explosion.a\n(Credit: KMCO)\nEmergency Response\nEmergency responders to the incident included KMCO’s Emergency Response Team, the Crosby Volunteer Fire\nDepartment (Figure 11), Mutual Aid Mont Belvieu, and responders from Harris County. Harris County\nresponders included the Sheriff’s Office and the Harris County Fire Marshal’s Office. KMCO also brought in\nU.S. Fire Pump to help with the firefighting. The incident triggered a shelter-in-place order for community\nmembers within a 1-mile radius [8].b\na According to KMCO’s evacuation plan, this gate was not intended to be an entrance or exit for workers. KMCO periodically unlocked\nand opened this gate to allow heavy equipment to enter or exit. At the time of the incident, this gate was in its usual position, closed and\nlocked for site security. Only one of KMCO’s four rally points was outside the plant fence line.\nb Officials lifted the shelter-in-place at 3:15 p.m., more than four hours after the explosion.\nPage 27\nInvestigation Report\nFigure 11. Emergency Response. This image from a KMCO surveillance camera shows\na fire truck entering the facility at about 11:28 a.m. (Credit: KMCO)\nEmergency responders transported Board Operator 1 and the Shift Supervisor by helicopter to a hospital in\nHouston to get medical treatment for the serious burn injuries they suffered (Figure 12).\nFigure 12. Life Flight Helicopter. One of the two helicopters that responded to the\nincident to transport injured workers. (Credit: ABC [9])\nKMCO conducted a headcount of its employees, contractors, and visitors and found that one KMCO employee,\nBoard Operator 2, was missing. Emergency responders found Board Operator 2 deceased under debris near the\nentrance to the R2 Building. During an emergency shutdown, one of Board Operator 2’s responsibilities\nincluded shutting down pumps, which required accessing electrical equipment located inside the R2 Building.\nPage 28\nInvestigation Report\nOther than shutting that equipment off, Board Operator 2 may have been entering the R2 Building to make sure\nno one was in there. At 12:07 p.m., medical responders evaluated Board Operator 2 and did not try to resuscitate\nhim. The Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences autopsy report shows that Board Operator 2 died from\n“sharp force injuries of the right upper extremity with transection of the right brachial artery and vein” resulting\nfrom an “accident” [10].\nR2 Building\nOne of the responders described what the R2 Building looked like right after the incident, saying, “Shrapnel. …\nThere was nothing left of it. Wires, there was nothing there. There wasn’t a building there anymore” (Figure 13,\nFigure 14, and Figure 15).\nPage 29\nInvestigation Report\nFigure 13. R2 Building (North Side).

Board Operator 1 and the Shift Supervisor suffered serious burn\ninjuries that resulted in inpatient hospitalization. The incident injured at least 28 other workers—five KMCO\nemployeesa and 23 contract workers [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. A shelter-in-place was issued to community members\nwithin one mile of the KMCO facility.\na In addition to Board Operator 2 being fatally injured, KMCO records show seven employee injuries resulting from the incident. Board\nOperator 1 and the Shift Supervisor sustained second- and third-degree burn injuries all over their bodies; one employee suffered from a\nblood clot, one employee experienced a lower back strain, and three employees developed respiratory issues.\nPage 32\nInvestigation Report\n3 Technical Analysis\nA timeline of key events is provided in Appendix B.\nThe Y-Strainer\nKMCO installed a filtration strainer (y-strainer) on the inlet (suction) piping to the isobutylene charge pump. A\ntypical application for a y-strainer is to remove solid particles from a liquid stream (Figure 16). The 3-inch y-\nstrainer had threaded ends, and KMCO added flange-to-threaded connections to allow the y-strainer to connect\nto the isobutylene piping flanges (Figure 4).\nFigure 16. Generic Y-Strainer. This graphic shows a generic depiction of a typical y-strainer\napplication—used to remove solid particles from a liquid stream. (Credit: Warden [16])\nThe CSB never found a documented reason for KMCO’s installation of this y-strainer. In an interview with one\nof the engineers who worked on the isobutylene project that replaced the isobutylene storage and piping system\nduring 2014 and 2015, the CSB learned that filtration was a significant concern during the early phases of the\nproject when KMCO planned to use carbon steel piping, because the type of pump the team was planning to use\nhad experienced reliability problems in other applications with small rust or sediment particles damaging certain\nelastomer components within the pump. To address this concern, the KMCO project team had considered using\na bag filter to protect the pump, but the importance of filtration was considered to be much lower after the\nproject team decided to use stainless steel piping. The team upgraded the piping to stainless steel to provide a\nPage 33\nInvestigation Report\nbetter long-term solution for the pump reliability issues experienced in other KMCO applications. The engineer\nexplained how he thought the cast iron y-strainer got installed:\nI do remember that the strainer or a filter was always on the project. And I remember\nonce I got the stainless [piping] that the need [for] that strainer all of a sudden went from\nway up here to way down there. So probably what I kind of remember […] thinking,\nokay, what do we use? And I’m almost sure that that’s probably where that [strainer]\ncame from. You know […] we used it in other places in the plant. I believe they even said\nit came out of spare parts. You know, they just went out there, pulled something off the\n[warehouse] shelf, you know, and [installed it]. […] We probably had that [strainer model\nin] other places in the plant. And that’s how it came about.\nWith the upgrade to stainless steel piping, the importance of the strainer as a filtration device did appear to be\nlow. KMCO workers did not recall ever needing to clean accumulated debris from the y-strainer. For example,\nwhen asked if the strainer had ever plugged or needed to be cleaned, one supervisor said, “The only time they’ve\never touched that strainer is when it was leaking.”\nPost-incident, the source of the isobutylene release was identified as the 3-inch y-strainer on the inlet (suction)\npiping to the isobutylene charge pump. The y-strainer was found with a hole, which was roughly 3 inches by 5.5\ninches, on its west side (Figure 17). Field Operator 1 confirmed that the location of this hole was consistent\nwith where he saw the isobutylene escaping.\nFigure 17. Y-Strainer. This photo shows the west side of the failed y-strainer involved in\nthe April 2, 2019, incident.

Using the KMCO warehouse inventory information, the CSB purchased\nan exemplar y-strainer for $171 that was the same make and model as the incident y-strainer (Figure 19). The\nCSB used this exemplar y-strainer in the metallurgical testing that determined why the incident y-strainer failed.\nPage 35\nInvestigation Report\nFigure 19. Exemplar Y-Strainer. The CSB purchased an exemplar y-strainer (left) using the inventory\ninformation available in KMCO’s warehouse. The image on the right shows the y-strainer involved in the\nincident. (Credit: CSB)\nThe supplier’s technical specifications (Figure 20) confirmed that the exemplar y-strainer had a gray irona (cast\niron) body with an internal stainless-steel strainer. Gray iron is a type of cast iron [17].\nFigure 20. Y-Strainer Technical Specifications. (Credit: [18])\nMetallurgical Evaluation of the Y-Strainer\nMetallurgical testing commissioned by the CSB determined that the cast iron y-strainer rupture resulted from a\nbrittle overload fracture driven by internal pressure. Brittle overload failures can be catastrophic in that there\nmay be no warning signs before the final fracture. Brittle failures often contain multiple cracks and separated\npieces, which is consistent with how the KMCO y-strainer failed [19, p. 369]. Based on the results from the\nmetallurgical testing of the incident and exemplar y-strainers, the CSB concludes that the cast iron y-strainer\na The technical specifications show that the y-strainer was manufactured to ASTM A126 Class B [18]. ASTM 126 is a “Standard\nSpecification for Gray Iron Castings for Valves, Flanges, and Pipe Fittings” [76]. ASTM 126 covers three classes (A, B, and C) “for\ncastings intended for use as valve pressure retaining parts, pipe fittings, and flanges” [76].\nPage 36\nInvestigation Report\nthat catastrophically failed on April 2, 2019, ruptured from a brittle overload fracture driven by internal\npressure.\n3.2.1 Cast Iron is a Brittle Material\nAs an equipment design philosophy, it is often desirable for equipment to leak before it breaks (“leak-before-\nbreak”). Among other things, a leak-before-break approach strives to provide the opportunity to discover a\nsmaller leak and then take corrective action before a fracture can occur, which would likely result in a larger\nrelease [20]. Material that exhibits ductile failure typically experiences significant stretching before separation\n(breaking) occurs. As a result, equipment made using a ductile material may provide a warning before breaking,\nsuch as by bulging, stretching, or leaking [21, p. 92]. Brittle materials typically do not provide such a warning\nbefore they fracture [22, p. 56]. As a result, constructing equipment from a ductile material (such as stainless\nsteel) rather than a brittle material (cast iron, for example) is typically in alignment with the leak-before-break\ndesign philosophy [19, p. 55].\nCast iron is widely recognized as a brittle material. As a result, numerous publications that provide good\npractice safety guidance either prohibit or warn against using cast iron equipment in certain hazardous\napplications, including flammable hydrocarbons such as isobutylene. These publications include:\nNFPA 58, Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code (Industry Standard):\n“Cast iron shall not be used as the material of construction for strainers…” [23, p. 27].\nAPI Recommended Practice 574: Inspection Practices for Piping System Components (Industry Standard):\n“Cast iron piping is generally used for nonhazardous service, such as water; it is generally not\nrecommended for pressurized hydrocarbon service because of its brittle nature” [24, p. 8].\nAPI Standard 2510: Design and Construction of LPG Installations (Industry Standard):\n“Low-ductility material such as cast iron, semisteel, malleable iron, and cast aluminum shall not be used\nin any pressure-retaining accessory parts” [25, p. 19].\nAlbright’s Chemical Engineering Handbook (Book):\n“Because of its brittleness, cast iron is normally not permitted for hydrocarbon streams” [26, p. 1552].\nBP Process Safety Series: Safe Handling of Light Ends (Book):\n“Cast iron should not be used for equipment parts containing light ends [methane to pentane] under\npressure. Cast iron is very brittle and is easily broken …” [27, p. 46].\nChemical Process Safety: Learning from Case Histories (Book):\n“Cast iron is undesirable (and prohibited by certain flammable liquid codes) because a brittle fracture\ncan lead to a massive leak” [28, p. 286].\nCorrosion Control in Petroleum Production (Book):\n“The cast irons as a family have very low ductility as compared to steels, and the strength is generally\nlower than that of the higher strength carbon and alloy steels. … Some operators do not allow the use of\nPage 37\nInvestigation Report\nthe less ductile cast irons in hydrocarbon service because of the chance of a brittle failure in case of an\naccident” [29, p. 79].\nLudwig’s Applied Process Design for Chemical and Petrochemical Plants (Book):\n“Never use cast iron fittings or pipe in process situations unless there is only gravity pressure head (or\nnot over 10 psig) or the fluid is non-hazardous” [30, p. 143].\nMetallurgy and Corrosion Control in Oil and Gas Production (Book):\n“[Cast irons] are seldom used on upstream oil and gas operations except for water service. … The long\nflakes of graphite … cause gray cast iron (also called cast iron) to be too brittle for any corrosion or\nfluid‐handling service” [22, p. 76].\nPerry’s Chemical Engineers’ Handbook (Book):\n“The code [ASME B16.4-1998, Gray Iron Threaded Fittings: Classes 125 and 250] places significant\nrestrictions on the use of cast iron, and its use is typically limited to low-pressure, noncritical,\nnonflammable services” [31, pp. 10-90].\n“The piping system shall have no pressure-containing components of cast iron or other nonductile\nmetal” [31, pp. 10-108].\nPlant Design and Operations (Book):\n“Cast iron is less expensive and in some cases more corrosion resistant than steel. Nevertheless, the use\nof cast iron pipe is undesirable in oil or gas service because of its brittleness” [32, p. 288].\nFire and Quench Tests of Refinery Valves (1963 Journal Article):\n“[C]ast-iron valves of any type (nodular, gray, or malleable) are not safe for refinery hydrocarbon\nservice …. It has been common practice in recent years to restrict the use of cast-iron valves to refinery\nlocations outside the limits of operating units or to services where failure would not add fuel to a fire”\n[33].\nCritical Elements in the Design of Piping Systems for Toxic Fluids (Conference Paper):\n“A worst case failure scenario for a hazardous/toxic system is the catastrophic result of a sudden\nrupture. The materials selection process should preclude the use of any low-ductility materials such as\ncast iron …. Their brittle behavior … eliminate their applicability for hazardous/toxic systems” [34, p.\n12].\nInherently Safer Latex Plants (Conference Paper):\n“Certain materials should be avoided which can lead to catastrophic failure. Cast iron is brittle in nature\nand it is best not to use it for process service” [35, p. 9].\nSafety concerns about using cast iron equipment for chemicals such as isobutylene have been raised for decades.\nIn fact, NFPA 58, the Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code, has prohibited the use of cast iron fittings in LPG piping\nsystems since 1931.\nPage 38\nInvestigation Report\nThe CSB concludes that existing industry standards and good Key Lesson\npractice safety guidance show that cast iron is a brittle\nCast iron is widely recognized as a brittle\nmaterial that should not have been used for an application\nmaterial that should not be used in hazardous\nsuch as KMCO’s liquid isobutylene piping system.\napplications, including applications that\ninvolve flammable or toxic chemicals.\n3.2.2 Liquid Thermal Expansion\nAt the time of the catastrophic y-strainer failure, process data showed that the isobutylene circulation loop was\noperating at less than 120 pounds per square inch (gauge), which was a normal pressure within this piping\nsystem. But KMCO did not measure or record the pressure within the charge pump piping, where the y-strainer\nwas located. High-pressure conditions could develop in the charge pump piping from scenarios that include\nliquid thermal expansion, fluid leaking back from the batch reactor through an isolation valve or from the\npressure-relief valve on the charge pump’s outlet piping, or a combination of these conditions.a\nLiquid thermal expansion occurs when liquids are heated.b When a system with a fixed volume is filled with a\nliquid and heated, liquid thermal expansion can generate high pressure within the system as the liquid expands\n[36, p. 77]. After completing the isobutylene charge to the batch reactor, the charge pump piping was isolated,\nwith a check valve preventing flow back into the circulation loop and a block valve preventing flow into the\nbatch reactor (Figure 3). Unlike the isobutylene circulation loop piping, the charge pump’s inlet piping—\nincluding the y-strainer—lacked a pressure-relief device to protect it from liquid thermal expansion.c\nIn its industry standard, API Standard 521, Pressure-relieving and Depressuring Systems, the API explains that\nambient heat gain within an isolated piping system is among the most common causes of overpressure from\nliquid thermal expansion. The API recommends installing a pressure-relief device if liquid thermal expansion is\na credible hazard [37, pp. 32-33].d\nWhen the isobutylene charge was completed (at 6:25 a.m.), process data showed that the isobutylene\ntemperature was approximately 55 degrees Fahrenheit (℉). At this time, the outdoor air temperature was about\n40 ℉, cooling the isobutylene within the isolated (and uninsulated) charge piping. Later in the morning, heating\nof the isobutylene occurred from a combination of warmer outdoor air (approaching 59 ℉) and, at some piping\na The CSB commissioned testing of the pressure-relief valve from the charge pump’s discharge (outlet) piping. Among other results, this\ntesting found that the pressure-relief valve leaked at an average rate of approximately 0.005 to 0.007 gallons per minute. In addition, a\nprevious failure of cast iron equipment at a refinery was attributed to high pressure developed from quickly closing a valve [27, p. 46].\nThe charge pump piping at KMCO was equipped with two actuated valves. The fast closing of these valves may have been a source of\nperiodic pressure increases with the charge pump piping.\nb Liquid thermal expansion is sometimes referred to as hydraulic expansion, thermal expansion, or liquid expansion.\nc KMCO did equip portions of the circulation pump piping, which could be isolated, with pressure-relief valves to protect from liquid\nthermal expansion.\nd The API uses “hydraulic expansion” to describe the high-pressure conditions that can be created by the increase in liquid volume that\ncan occur when the temperature of a liquid increases [37, p. 32].\nPage 39\nInvestigation Report\nlocations, exposure to the sun (solar radiation). This heating likely increased the pressure inside the piping from\nliquid thermal expansion.a\nThis scenario for developing high pressure inside the charge piping after\nadding isobutylene to the batch reactor would not have been unique to the\nKey Lesson\nmorning of April 2, 2019. Indeed, high pressure within the isobutylene\ncharge piping likely developed during a number of previous batches under Piping systems should be\nequipped with protection from\nsimilar, or even more severe, heating conditions. Any such previous high-\nhigh-pressure conditions,\npressure events would likely have contributed to the incident through\nwhere liquid thermal expansion\nweakening of the y-strainer, such as by creating small cracks within the\nor other scenarios can create a\nstrainer body that further developed during repeated pressure cycles and\nhazard. For example, API 521\nultimately resulted in failure when the internal isobutylene pressure finally\nrecommends installing a\nexceeded the strainer’s ability to contain this pressure. The CSB concludes\npressure-relief device if liquid\nthat the most likely source of pressure contributing to the y-strainer failure thermal expansion is a credible\nwas liquid isobutylene thermal expansion that might have periodically hazard.\noccurred within the charge pump’s inlet piping, which was not equipped\nwith a pressure-relief device or otherwise protected from high-pressure\nconditions.\nIsobutylene Release\nJust before the isobutylene release began, the liquid level within the isobutylene storage tank was about 43.1\npercent. After the isobutylene tank was isolated following the incident, the liquid level in the isobutylene storage\ntank was about 41.5 percent. Based on this change in level and accounting for temperature differences between\nthe initial and final conditions, the CSB determined that more than 10,000 pounds of isobutylene were released\nduring the incident.b\nIgnition Source\nThe area of the greatest explosion damage was the R2 Building, where Board Operator 2 was found deceased.\nThe explosion damage to the R2 Building was consistent with flammable vapor being ignited within that\nbuilding. This building contained a number of electrical equipment items that were energized and likely capable\nof igniting the isobutylene vapor cloud, triggering the explosion. Minimal details about the construction of this\nbuilding were available, but the building was generally understood to be consistent with the construction of the\nPPE Room, which contained multiple doors, windows, and other obvious potential entry points for flammable\nisobutylene vapor, including a poorly sealed wall-mounted air conditioner (Figure 21).\na The outdoor air temperature at 10:40 a.m. was about 59 ℉.\nb The isobutylene storage tank was equipped with two level transmitters. Because one of these was producing an erratic signal, it was\nexcluded from the isobutylene release calculation.\nPage 40\nInvestigation Report\nFigure 21. Wall-Mounted Air Conditioner. This photo, taken from outside of the\nPPE Room, shows an opening to the inside of the PPE Room. (Credit: CSB)\nKMCO had identified the area where the R2 Building was located as a Class 1, Division 2 location, one of the\nhazardous classified locations under the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 70, National Electrical\nCode, where the possibility of fire or explosion hazards may exist under abnormal conditions because of the\npresence of flammable material, such as isobutylene [38, p. 350]. The CSB learned that the R2 Building likely\ndid not meet the NFPA’s requirements because it contained unclassified electrical equipment, such as motor\nstarters, and the building was not pressurized to prevent flammable vapor from entering the building.\nIn addition, KMCO had not implemented its insurance underwriting recommendation from 2013 to “harden”\ncertain electrical equipment inside the R2 Building or relocate this electrical equipment to the new blast-\nresistant Reaction Control Room. The most recent status update for this insurance recommendation, prepared in\n2018, showed a long-term plan to move this equipment into a more robust “blast-resistant” housing.\nThe CSB concludes that although a number of potential sources of ignition existed in the area of the isobutylene\nrelease, the source of ignition that triggered the isobutylene explosion was most likely located within the R2\nBuilding.\nFederal Safety Regulations\nKMCO records show that its isobutylene system was covered by both the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health\nAdministration’s (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and the U.S. Environmental Protection\nAgency’s (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule [39].\nPage 41\nInvestigation Report\n3.5.1 OSHA Process Safety Management Standard\nOSHA’s PSM standard was implemented on May 26, 1992. According to OSHA, the PSM standard:\n[E]stablishes procedures for process safety management that will protect employees by\npreventing or minimizing the consequences of chemical accidents involving highly\nhazardous chemicals. Employees have been and continue to be exposed to the hazards of\ntoxicity, fires, and explosions from catastrophic releases of highly hazardous chemicals\nin their workplaces. The requirements in this standard are intended to eliminate or\nmitigate the consequences of such releases [40].\nKMCO considered its isobutylene system covered by the OSHA PSM standarda because of the chemical\nquantities used or stored.b KMCO records show that the isobutylene system was likely covered by the PSM\nstandard because it contained more than 10,000 pounds of the flammable chemical.\n3.5.2 KMCO’s Process Safety Management Program\nIn January 2017, KMCO’s process safety management system was evaluated by an audit team. The audit team\nassessed the company’s conformance with process safety management regulations and industry good practice\nguidance, including OSHA’s PSM standard, EPA’s RMP rule, and the Center for Chemical Process Safety\n(CCPS) book, Risk Based Process Safety. In total, the audit team used 370 different questions to evaluate the\nsite’s process safety management program and made recommendations for 341 (92 percent) of these questions.\nFor the remaining 29 (8 percent) questions evaluated, the audit team did not make a recommendation.\nA number of the audit team’s recommendations specifically targeted improving KMCO’s process safety\nmanagement systems, including emergency response and hazard evaluation, that later contributed to the April 2,\n2019, incident.\nFor example, the audit identified that KMCO’s emergency response plan did not deal with training requirements\nand recommended that KMCO conduct an additional audit to evaluate what exactly occurs at the site during an\nemergency. Another audit recommendation was that KMCO hold routine training to ensure that its employees\nunderstood that their role was not to respond to an emergency but that they should evacuate with the\nunderstanding that response should only be handled by qualified outside emergency responders.\nWith respect to KMCO’s hazard evaluation programs, the 2017 audit found substantial issues with the site’s\nprocess hazard analysis (PHA) program, concluding that the existing PHAs were “not in line with industry\nstandards” and recommended that KMCO ensure that an initial PHA had been performed for all covered\nprocesses, existing PHAs were replaced by updated (re-do) PHAs, process safety information was compiled, and\nthat KMCO addresses previous incidents in its future PHAs.\na 29 C.F.R. § 1910.119.\nb The PSM Standard covers chemicals deemed hazardous because of their chemical composition and quantity (listed in Appendix A of 29\nC.F.R. § 1910.119) or because of their flammability characteristics. See 29 C.F.R. § 1910.119(a)(1)(ii).\nPage 42\nInvestigation Report\nKMCO’s 2017 audit showed that the company’s process safety management program had significant\nweaknesses, which KMCO’s management team was taking action to address. In discussing the recent audit\nfindings with CSB investigators, one senior manager explained that KMCO had been continually trying to raise\nthe level of its process safety performance. He stated:\nWe’ve been working diligently on a lot [of the audit findings] since I’ve been here. We’ve\nre-inspected the entire plant to build new [piping and instrumentation diagrams]. We’ve\ninstalled a new [management of change] process. We’ve redone the incident\ninvestigation. We’ve been looking very carefully at our mechanical integrity, re-\ninspecting many things, and trying to work through that. Trying to upgrade all aspects of\nprocess safety.\nAmong the recent improvements, KMCO’s management placed an emphasis on reviewing all recent incident\ninvestigations to discuss the findings and ensure that effective corrective actions were being developed. On the\nday of the incident, the Shift Supervisor was attending one of these meetings when the y-strainer ruptured.\nOverall, many employees interviewed by the CSB were complimentary of the recent equipment and\ninfrastructure projects along with other management efforts to improve the facility. For example, one\nexperienced operator stated:\nI would say that a lot of like our safe work program and stuff that they … they put in\nthere, they’re much more thorough. Our safe works used to have like five lines on it, and\nnow it’s a standard form, you know, and covers anything and everything that you can\nthink of on there. And having the 4-gas meters in the field, which we didn’t have before.\nThere’s … there’s a lot of things they’ve improved on. Like I said, especially in the\nprocesses and the safety of the processes have been improved.\nBut one supervisor explained that although the infrastructure and other improvements were good, KMCO’s\nmanagement needed to do more to keep people out of harm’s way. He explained that the ERT’s lack of\noperating experience and their slow response to incidents resulted in site management continually relying on\nKMCO’s operators to react quickly to stop the leak or problem.\nAlthough KMCO had been working to identify gaps and strengthen its process safety management system,\npersistent weaknesses ultimately contributed to the April 2, 2019, incident. Poorly implemented elements of\nKMCO’s process safety management system, including emergency response and hazard evaluation, were\nidentified as safety issues in the CSB’s investigation. These safety issues are further analyzed in Section 4.1 and\nSection 4.3, respectively.\n3.5.3 OSHA Enforcement Actions\nOn September 30, 2019, OSHA issued citations to KMCO stemming from the April 2, 2019, incident with a\nproposed penalty of $131,274 [41]. These citations included the following:\n• KMCO did not train all employees in safe and orderly evacuation (29 C.F.R. § 1910.38(e)).\nPage 43\nInvestigation Report\n• Material of construction information was not maintained for the y-strainer that failed or the\nisobutylene piping from the storage tank to the reactor system (29 C.F.R. § 1910.119(d)(3)(i)(A)).\n• KMCO’s process safety information did not include the pressure relief valve design and design\nbasis for certain safety relief valves that provide equipment overpressure protection (29 C.F.R. §\n1910.119(d)(3)(i)(D)).\n• For certain safety relief valves that provided overpressure protection, KMCO did not document that\nthe equipment complied with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices such as\nAPI 521 (29 C.F.R. § 1910.119(d)(3)(ii)).\n• KMCO’s PHA did not address the hazards of the y-strainer that failed or the hazards of an\nisobutylene release without installing remote emergency isolation valves (29 C.F.R. §\n1910.119(e)(3)(i)).\n• KMCO did not perform inspections and testing of the y-strainer that failed (29 C.F.R. §\n1910.119(j)(4)(i)).\n• KMCO did not have written procedures to manage changes for the reactor system piping and\ninstrumentation diagrams or for the y-strainer that failed (29 C.F.R. § 1910.119(l)(1)).\n• KMCO did not effectively implement its emergency response plan (29 C.F.R. § 1910.120(q)(1)).\n• The employee alarm system at KMCO did not provide a warning for necessary emergency action\nwhen the alarm system was not activated by the incident commander. In addition, training and\ndrills required by the emergency action plan were not performed (29 C.F.R. § 1910.165(b)(1)).\n3.5.4 EPA Risk Management Program Rule\nThe EPA’s RMP rule requires an owner or operator of a stationary source with a process that has more than a\nthreshold quantity of a regulated substance to develop a risk management plan.a According to the EPA, these\nplans:\n• Identify the potential effects of a chemical accident;\n• Identify the steps the facility is taking to prevent an accident; and\n• Spell out emergency response procedures should an accident occur [42].\nThe EPA’s RMP rule defines three Program levels (Program 1, 2, or 3) based on the potential consequences to\nthe public and the effort needed to prevent accidents [43, p. 1]. Of these three Program levels, Program 1 is the\nleast stringent, and Program 3 is the most rigorous.\nKMCO filed a risk management plan with the EPA on February 23, 2018 [39]. KMCO included isobutylene in\nits risk management plan, and the company identified its isobutylene system as being a Program Level 3 [39, p.\n5]. KMCO’s risk management plan submission also identified that its isobutylene system was regulated by both\nthe EPA RMP rule and the OSHA PSM standard [39, p. 33].\na 40 C.F.R. § 68.10.\nPage 44\nInvestigation Report\nIn its risk management plan, KMCO explained its policies for emergency response and accidental release\nprevention. KMCO said that if a significant release were to occur, its emergency response personnel would\nrespond and control the release. KMCO’s risk management plan states:\nKMCO is committed to the safety of KMCO workers and the public, and to the\npreservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of\nhazardous substances. KMCO implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable\nreleases of hazardous substances. In the event of a significant accidental release, our\ntrained Emergency Response personnel will respond to control and contain such releases.\nKMCO evaluates each situation, evacuates workers as necessary, and contacts the local\nfire department to control and contain the release and to prevent and/or reduce the\nconsequences of the release [44].\nPage 45\nInvestigation Report\n4 Safety Issues\nThis section includes an analysis of the safety issues that contributed to the incident or its severity, including:\n• Emergency Response\n• Remote Isolation\n• Hazard Evaluation\nSee Appendix A for the accident map (AcciMap), which provides a graphical analysis of this incident.\nEmergency Response\n4.1.1 Emergency Response Plan\nKMCO’s Emergency Response Plan (ERP) established procedures to follow in the event of an emergency, such\nas a large release of flammable isobutylene. According to the KMCO’s ERP, the steps to be taken during such\nan emergency included:\n Communicating the nature of the emergency using the plant-wide radio and the facility alarm system;\n Unlocking gate turnstiles and gathering visitor sign-in sheets to help account for all personnel at the\ndesignated rally points;\n Ensuring nonessential employees evacuate and report to a safe rally point;\n Evacuating operations personnel based on the type and magnitude of the incident;\n Assembling the Emergency Response Team (ERT) members at the ERT muster location;\n Forming an Emergency Operations Center (EOC) with the assigned personnel; and\n Assigning the operations shift supervisor as the initial Incident Commander focused on “life safety and\nincident stability.” The initial goals for the incident commander included:\n Focusing on “possible hazards to human health or the environment that may result from the\nRelease, Fire, or Explosion;”\n Designating the command center, exclusionary zone, and support zone; and\n Ordering a shelter-in-place or evacuation if the incident could threaten human health or the\nenvironment.\nLike many of the safety management systems at KMCO, the site’s ERP was actively being revised and\nstrengthened, but the updated version was not effective on the day of the incident. For example, KMCO’s ERP\ncalled for the operations shift supervisor to serve as the initial Incident Commander, but the Shift Supervisor on\nduty at the time of the incident had not been a member of the ERT for about two years.\nPage 46\nInvestigation Report\nThe site had scheduled an incident command training activity for April 5, 2019, but the April 2, 2019, incident\noccurred before this training could take place. The April 5, 2019, training was supposed to provide a tabletop\ndrill with the Crosby Volunteer Fire Department. At this training session, KMCO also planned to clarify who\nwould serve as the initial Incident Commander and what their role was during an emergency.\n4.1.2 Facility Alarm System\nIn its book Guidelines for Risk Based Process Safety, the CCPS covered both the importance and objectives of a\nfacility’s emergency alarm system. Among other good practice safety guidance for emergency alarm systems,\nthe CCPS stated:\nIn the event of an emergency, a reliable means must be available to alert those in danger\nthat they should take action, and specifically what action to take.\nRegardless of the method used to alert people to an emergency, the alarm must be\nrecognizable, and clearly distinguishable from normal message traffic carried on\nwhatever media is used [45, p. 523].\nEnsure that all personnel at the facility, including contractors, can recognize emergency\nalarms and know what actions to take for each type of alarm [45, p. 537].\nAfter Board Operator 1 left the Reaction Control Room in response to the radio call from Field Operator 1, he\nappeared to understand the seriousness of the emergency. Board Operator 1 used the radio to inform other\nworkers of the emergency by calling for an evacuation from the area, but nobody activated the facility alarm\nsystem. As a result, workers who did not have a radio—or were not with someone who had a radio—were not\nalerted to the ongoing emergency or the call to evacuate.\nKMCO’s emergency response plan (ERP) called for using both the facility alarm system and the plant-wide\nradio to immediately communicate an emergency, including a chemical release, fire, or explosion. KMCO’s\nboard operators were not responsible for deciding to sound the facility alarm system during an emergency. In\nexplaining the purpose of the facility alarm system, the emergency response plan explained:\nThe primary purpose of the facility alarm system is to put the plant on alert status. The\nfacility alarm system shall be used during an emergency situation that has the potential\nto impact KMCO employees, contractors, the community, and/or major property loss.\nThe activation of the emergency alarm is at the discretion of the HSSE [Health, Safety,\nSecurity, Environmental] Department, Operations and/or Maintenance Department\nManager and Supervisors.\nKMCO installed its facility alarm system in February 2017 to “notify the entire plant of an emergency\nsituation.” The alarm system included:\n• An alarm base station in the Reaction Control Room (Figure 22);\n• Voice options to alert employees to specific emergency events;\n• Speakers on concrete poles around the facility;\nPage 47\nInvestigation Report\n• Speakers in the administration and maintenance buildings; and\n• Radio and mobile phone notification of emergencies.a\nFigure 22. Base Station for Facility Alarm System. (Credit: CSB)\nOne operations supervisor stated that the old facility alarm system never worked—or at least, not during his 14\nyears at KMCO—and that he had never heard a facility alarm until the new system was up and running.\nKMCO personnel routinely tested its new facility alarm system each Tuesday, but beyond knowing how to run\nthe weekly test, most workers did not know how to use the alarm for an actual emergency. Workers could\nactivate the evacuation alarm only from the Reaction Control Room. When asked if people knew how to sound\nthe evacuation alarm on the facility alarm system, one operations supervisor said, “No. They know how to use it\nto do its weekly test.”\nIn discussing the actions to take during a hypothetical isobutylene release, another operations supervisor\ndescribed how he could use the facility alarm system to evacuate the plant. He said:\nYou would turn the key on. And then, it’s got a button that you would hit. I don’t\nremember the exact name of it. One is evacuate, one is shelter-in-place, and one is the\nweekly test. So, you’d hit the evacuate. Hit the appropriate button and hit send. I’ve never\nactually hit it, so I can’t even tell you what it would sound like. I’m assuming it’s the\nweekly test without the voice saying, “This is a test.”\nWhen asked who should activate the facility alarm and how the facility alarm system works, a third operations\nsupervisor stated, “Nobody knows.” The supervisor further clarified by saying, “There has been a number of\na OSHA provides minimum requirements for employee alarm systems in 29 C.F.R. § 1910.165.\nPage 48\nInvestigation Report\n[employment] changes to people that were part of the [facility alarm system] installation. They [no longer work]\nhere.”\nOne of the KMCO safety technicians provided further insight by explaining that, at the time of the incident, the\noperations staff was not yet capable of reliably activating the facility alarm system during an emergency. He\nsaid:\nYeah, [we have a facility alarm system]. It’s a Cadillac, too. It’s a really nice one. It was\nprobably put in a couple of years ago, but nobody’s up to speed trained on it.\nThere should be board operators who say I know exactly what to hit [on the facility alarm\nsystem] in every situation to sound which alarm and why. But we didn’t get that piece\n[completed] yet.\nBecause, like I said, it’s a really nice alarm, but if you don’t know how to use it and\nyou’re not training your employees on it, it’s useless.\nBecause KMCO’s board operators were not yet fully trained to use the facility alarm system, the safety\ntechnician explained how he trained new workers on what to do during a potential emergency. He instructed\nnew workers at the site to rely on the plant radio system or to contact operations, or if they saw people running,\nhe advised that they should run with them. The safety technician said:\nLike, I’ll do a lot of the safety orientation when [workers] first come to the site. I show\nthem all the rally points, I point out the windsocks. I’ll say in an unlikely event [of an\nemergency], like, Channel 1 is [the primary radio channel] for safety. But, like, if they\ndon’t have a radio, like, get with operations, or if you see a whole bunch of people running\none way, it’s probably a good idea to run in that same direction.\nBased on the interviews that CSB investigators conducted with KMCO employees and contract workers who\nwere at the facility, KMCO did not use its facility alarm system for emergency communication about the\nisobutylene release. Because not all workers received the plant radio emergency notification, some injured\nworkers were nearer to the explosion than they should have been. In addition, the lack of facility alarm system\nemergency communication likely made the plant evacuation more hectic than it otherwise could have been. For\nexample, during the isobutylene release, KMCO’s operators and supervisors were urgently instructing other\nworkers to shut off vehicles and evacuate when the facility alarm system could have provided a more effective\napproach for this emergency communication.\nThe CSB concludes that KMCO never activated its facility\nKey Lesson\nalarm system to notify all workers about the isobutylene\nrelease emergency.

Employers\nhave a duty to protect their employees from harm. As part of their efforts to conform with OSHA’s PSM\nstandard, companies like KMCO decide what their employees will do during an emergency.a If a company\nintends to evacuate all its employees following a major chemical release, the company may develop an\n“emergency action plan” following 29 C.F.R. 1910.38(a). Otherwise, the company needs to develop an\n“emergency response plan” under 29 C.F.R. 1910.120(q) (which addresses “emergency response to hazardous\nsubstance releases”).b\nKMCO chose to develop an emergency response plan. In doing so, KMCO accepted responsibility for\nimplementing an emergency response plan under 29 C.F.R. 1910.120(q) because some of its employees were\nexpected to handle an emergency release rather than evacuate [46, p. 11]. As such, the actions that KMCO\nworkers took in response to the April 2, 2019, incident were the product of KMCO’s policies and procedures\nand how the company prepared and trained these workers to respond to this emergency.\nGood practice guidance for emergency response is widely available from a number of sources. Among these, the\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services has developed 6 Steps for Initial Response to a Chemical\nHAZMAT Incident that prioritizes life safety using plain language.c The six steps are:\n1. Recognize the Incident: Quickly size up the situation and recognize the type and scale of incident you\nare responding to. Activate the response system.\n2. Protect Yourself and Others: Establish an Isolation Zone and move outside it. Alert others in the\ndanger area to do the same. Take only actions that you are equipped and trained to take. Do not allow\nyourself to become a victim!\n3. Determine Initial Response Objectives: Remind yourself of the critical objectives that should be\naddressed in the first minutes. Life safety is always your first priority.\n4. Decide and Take Immediate Actions: Make the decisions that will support your objectives - and take\nthe actions you safely can.\n5. Manage the Incident Until Relieved: The first arriving responder is, by default, the Incident\nCommander until relieved. You should control the incident scene and manage and apply resources as\nthey arrive.\n6. Transition Command: Formally turn over incident command when more senior or more qualified\nresponders arrive [47].d\na The EPA also has emergency response requirements under 40 C.F.R. §§ 68.90 - 68.96. The provisions for emergency response\nexercises under 40 C.F.R. § 68.96 were not in effect at the time of the incident at KMCO [88].\nb 29 C.F.R. § 1910.38(a) and 29.C.F.R. § 1910.120(q).\nc HAZMAT is an abbreviation for hazardous materials. Quick Response Guide - CHEMM (hhs.gov)\nd Quick Response Guide - CHEMM (hhs.gov)\nPage 50\nInvestigation Report\nWhen the y-strainer ruptured, which initiated the release of flammable isobutylene, the three KMCO workers\nwho were fatally or seriously injured (Board Operator 2, Board Operator 1, and the Shift Supervisor) were all in\na safe location. The two board operators were working inside the blast-resistant Reaction Control Room, and the\nsupervisor was attending a safety meeting in a conference room within the plant’s administration building.\nWhen the flammable isobutylene vapor cloud exploded 11 minutes later, all of these workers were in harm’s\nway; and were fatally or seriously injured while performing actions either within or near the flammable\nisobutylene vapor cloud.\n4.1.3.1 HAZWOPER\nOn March 6, 1989, OSHA issued its Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response standard, more\ncommonly referred to as HAZWOPER.a Among other things, this safety regulation provides minimum\nrequirements for emergency response operations involving hazardous materials, such as isobutylene. In the\npreamble to its HAZWOPER standard, OSHA stated that there was a “clear need for training and other\nprovisions to protect workers engaged in all emergency responses when there is the possibility of hazardous\nsubstance spills” [48, p. 9297]. OSHA further stated that its decision to cover all emergency response, including\npetrochemical and similar manufacturing facilities, “was based upon the high risk associated with emergency\nresponse by untrained and unprotected employees and the need for proper training and equipment to be provided\nfor emergency response to hazardous substance releases” [48, p. 9298].\nOSHA requires emergency responders to be trained before taking part in emergency response operations. This\ntraining must be based on the duties they will perform [49, p. 30]. In its HAZWOPER standard, OSHA\nidentified five emergency response levels and the minimum training requirements for each level. These\nemergency response levels are:\n1. First Responder Awareness Level\nThese are employees who might witness or discover a hazardous substance release and have been\ntrained to report the release to start the emergency response process.\n2. First Responder Operations Level\nThese are employees who respond for the purpose of protecting other people nearby, property, or the\nenvironment from the effects of the release. They do not try to stop the release. From a safe distance,\nthey try to contain the release and prevent exposure to released material.\n3. Hazardous Materials Technician\nThese responders can approach the release to close valves or take other, more aggressive actions to stop\nthe release.\n4. Hazardous Materials Specialist\na 29 C.F.R. § 1910.120.\nPage 51\nInvestigation Report\nThese responders support the hazardous materials technicians. They have duties similar to the hazardous\nmaterials technician but have more knowledge about hazardous materials, and they also coordinate with\nother officials about emergency response.\n5. On Scene Incident Commander\nThe incident commander controls the emergency response to the incident beyond the first responder\nawareness level [49, pp. 30-32].a\nThe three KMCO workers who were fatally or seriously injured\nKey Lesson\n(Board Operator 2, Board Operator 1, and the Shift Supervisor)\nhad approached or entered the isobutylene vapor cloud in\nWhere remote isolation is not provided\nresponse to the release, but they were not formal members of the or is otherwise not available, clear\nsite’s ERT. Some of the actions these workers took, such as policies and effective training are needed\nclosing valves to stop the release, were the duties of a hazardous to help ensure that workers do not put\nmaterials technician under OSHA’s HAZWOPER standard. But themselves in danger to stop a chemical\nrelease.\nbecause these workers were not trained to that response level,\nKMCO should have limited the role of these employees to the\nfirst responder awareness level.b\n4.1.3.2 Response to Hazardous Material Incidents at KMCO\nIndustrial safety and accident analysis expert Andrew Hopkins has stated that the most useful definition of\nculture in the context of company safety practices is “The way we do things around here,” a definition that refers\nto the collective practices of a group [50, 51].c This definition of culture is helpful in describing the actions\nKMCO workers took when responding to the isobutylene release.\nKMCO hired its ERT Fire Chief roughly two years before the April 2, 2019, incident. The Fire Chief told CSB\ninvestigators that, among other challenges, “we had to build [the emergency response program] from the ground\nup.” The Fire Chief also stated that the plant culture at KMCO was that operations staff should take offensive\nactions to stop a release quickly. In discussing the isobutylene release on April 2, 2019, the Fire Chief said,\n“they [operations staff] are going to respond to it and try to mitigate it as fast as possible so they can contain it.”\nThe Fire Chief further explained:\nIf [the operators] can go out there and block it in, theoretically, real quick and, like,\nneutralize it or keep it contained, that’s going to be their primary thought pattern. A Good\nSamaritan, they want to do the right thing right away.\na 29 C.F.R § 1910.120(q)(6)(i) – 1910.120(q)(6)(v).\nb 29 C.F.R. § 1910.120 (q)(6)(i).\nc The CSB had previously found that the phrase “the way we do things around here” might originate in Marvin Bower’s 1966 book, The\nWill to Manage, in which Bower used the phrase to explain how top executives at successful firms referred to the company’s\nphilosophy [85, pp. 22-41]. At the time, Marvin Bower was the managing director for the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, Inc.\nSee Company philosophy: ‘The way we do things around here’.\nPage 52\nInvestigation Report\nBut if it’s out of control, they’re going to still call ERT because we’re going to be\nHAZMAT trained. We’ll help clean it up, start the dike walls and all that, but like to say,\n“Oh, there’s a leak, ERT emergency leak,” you know, it’s not always that way.\nBut if they can contain it themselves, they’ll just block it in and try to fix it. Plug it up\nmost of the time.\nThe ERT Fire Chief’s explanation that KMCO’s plant culture called for operators to quickly respond to try to\nstop a release closely aligned with how the Shift Supervisor recalled the events that transpired. After being\nreleased from the hospital, the Shift Supervisor described the incident in an interview with a CSB investigator:\nI get a call on the radio [saying that] we have [an isobutylene] leak. So, at this point, you\nknow, being used to what happens normally at [the batch reactor], an [isobutylene] leak\nnormally is a very small leak coming from a valve or coming from a … the [charge] pump\nitself. But we still go down there. And as I’m going down there, I can see in the middle\n… on the road that separates the […] tank farm and [the batch reactor] area, there’s a\ntwo-foot river high that goes all the way down the road, of isobutylene [vapor]. At that\npoint, when I had seen that, I got on the [plant radio] and ordered the evacuation of the\nplant. And as I ordered the evacuation of the plant, that’s when I [saw Board Operator 1\nand Board Operator 2] going towards the units with the SCBA on.\nBoard Operators 1 and 2 each wore an SCBA and their standard everyday flame-resistant clothing. When asked\nabout the personal protective equipment that Board Operator 1 and Board Operator 2 were wearing, the Shift\nSupervisor explained that this was the only personal protective equipment they had for that response. The Shift\nSupervisor also stated that Board Operator 1 and Board Operator 2 were “doing what they were trained to do.”\nSo, the outside operators had already been out of the area. And one was sent to go shut\nthe [circulation] pump off. And [Board Operator 1] went in there and shut the valves so\nthe leak would stop. And then [he] opened up the overhead … the deluge system. Which\nis something that, you know, if we ever have leaks like this, the best thing to do is drown\nit in water. So that’s what he was doing.\nThe Shift Supervisor also explained that Board Operator 2 may have gone into the R2 Building to push the stop\nbutton for two reactor feed pumps in his area and to make sure that no one else was in that building.\nThe explosion occurred just after the Shift Supervisor had turned on a firewater monitor to keep the isobutylene\nvapor away from a hot oil furnace that was to the south and east of the release location.\n4.1.3.3 CCPS Safety Guidance\nIn its book, Guidelines for Risk Based Process Safety, the CCPS recommends that written emergency response\nprograms “clearly delineate” which incidents operators should respond to and which incidents should be handled\nby the site’s emergency response team. The CCPS explained that:\nPage 53\nInvestigation Report\nThe written emergency response program, or a subordinate document, should clearly\ndelineate between those incidents that operators should respond to and those that should\nbe handled by the facility’s emergency response team (ERT) or equivalently trained\noutside responders. Failure to address this issue will require that operators and other front\nline employees make instant decisions on how to respond to an emergency, likely leading\nto unacceptable risk because people generally do a poor job of considering a wide range\nof factors when making decisions in a crisis [45, p. 514].\nThe CCPS also discussed the natural tendency for some operators to feel ownership of the unit and want to take\nquick action during an emergency. The CCPS explained:\nOperators normally have a much deeper understanding of the process and its hazards than\ndo emergency responders and can normally act more quickly in terms of both (1)\nformulating a response action and (2) executing the action. However, operators are\ngenerally not as well equipped as emergency responders (in terms of response and\npersonal protective equipment) and are almost certainly not as well trained in emergency\nresponse activities. Because they feel a certain ownership of the process, some operators\nmay accept more personal risk while responding to an emergency than the company\nmight endorse. This ownership issue, and the need to understand tolerable risk when\nresponding to emergencies, can best be managed if the range of acceptable actions is\ndocumented, reviewed, and communicated to operators and other affected workers in\nwriting, and reinforced in training situations [45, p. 514].\nIn addition, the CCPS compared operators who might put themselves in harm’s way during an emergency to the\n“confined space rescue” problem, where workers who lack the right training and equipment put themselves in\nharm’s way by trying to rescue an unresponsive coworker during a confined space work activity. The CCPS\nexplained:\nIn addition to being trained on what to do, all personnel should understand management’s\nintent for emergency response. What actions are acceptable and what are not? Many\nworkers, when faced with an emergency, will pursue unsafe actions to mitigate the\nconsequences, particularly if a co-worker could be injured. For example, a high incidence\nof double fatalities occurs for confined space incidents: first the person working in the\nconfined space collapses, and shortly afterward, a co-worker collapses while attempting\nto rescue the first victim. Policy issues such as, “Do not attempt to take offensive actions\nsuch as ….” should be clearly communicated to all personnel and reinforced periodically\nthrough training or other communication modes [45, p. 523].\nPage 54\nInvestigation Report\nThe CSB concludes that KMCO’s emergency response system, including its\nprocedures and training, contributed to the severity of the incident. KMCO Key Lesson\ndid not establish procedures or provide training that effectively distinguished\nEmergency response plans,\nthe incidents that its operators should respond to from the emergency events\nincluding procedures and\nthat the site’s emergency response team must respond to.

KMCO could have reduced the severity of the event by emergency response team.\nestablishing clear policies and training its workforce to respond to a chemical\nrelease without putting themselves in harm’s way.\nRemote Isolation\nIn his interview with the CSB, the Shift Supervisor was asked what changes he would want to see implemented\nto prevent this type of event from occurring in the future. The Shift Supervisor stated:\nYou should have had valves that you can close inside [the Reaction Control Room]. I\nmean, when you have an incident … when you have [ethylene oxide, propylene oxide],\n[isobutylene], any kind of flammable liquid, you should be able to [stop it remotely] and,\nyou know, not send someone in to have to do it.\nWhen the y-strainer ruptured, the closest person to it was the contract worker who was insulating tubing\nassociated with the batch reactor. She described that when the y-strainer failed, the flammable isobutylene vapor\nwas chest-high, growing, and flowing down the adjacent road. In her interview with Harris County Fire Marshal\ninvestigators, she opined about how to prevent a similar event in the future, stating:\nShut the line. … There should be a way to shut the line. … Once we know what it is, shut\nthe line. … Is there such a thing that they could have went somewhere and just, like shut\nit all down? Then [Board Operator 2] could have been saved. No one should have went\nback out there [into that flammable vapor cloud].\nThe Shift Supervisor and the contract insulator each identified the need for safety equipment that KMCO\nworkers could have used to stop the isobutylene release from a safe location. This type of safety equipment is\ncalled remote isolation (among other names), and it is not a new safety concept. Nearly 50 years before the\nexplosion at KMCO, process safety pioneer Trevor Kletz published a safety newsletter that called for installing\nremotely operated isolation valves to isolate hazardous material leaks from a safe distance.a\na See Safety Newsletter Introduction and Issue 14. The Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE) provides the entire series of ICI\nNewsletters on its website.\nPage 55\nInvestigation Report\nThe CSB refers to the equipment needed to isolate a flammable or toxic release from a safe (remote) location as\na remotely operated emergency isolation valve (ROEIV). While a remotely operated emergency isolation valve\nwill not prevent a loss-of-containment event, correctly applying remote isolation equipment should reduce the\nseverity of a hazardous chemical release [52, p. 4].a\n4.2.1 Health and Safety Executive (HSE) Safety Guidance\nThe Health and Safety Executive (HSE), a United Kingdom government agency, published HSG244, Remotely\nOperated Shutoff Valves (ROSOVs) in 2004 [53]. HSE issued its guidance on remotely operated shutoff valves\nbecause of two major incidents:\n• The Associated Octel Company Limited at Ellesmere Port (February 1994);b and\n• The BP Grangemouth Refinery (June 2000) [53, pp. 4-5].c\nIn explaining the purpose of its ROSOV guidance document, HSE says, “In an emergency, rapid isolation of\nvessels or process plant is one of the most effective means of preventing loss of containment, or limiting its\nsize” [53, p. 4]. ROSOVs are safety devices that HSE defines as:\nA valve designed, installed and maintained for the primary purpose of achieving rapid\nisolation of plant items containing hazardous substances in the event of a failure of the\nprimary containment system (including, but not limited to, leaks from pipework, flanges,\nand pump seals). Closure of the valve can be initiated from a point remote from the valve\nitself. The valve should be capable of closing and maintaining tight shutoff under\nforeseeable conditions following such a failure (which may include fire) [53, p. 4].\nHSG244 provides four primary selection criteria for eliminating “low-risk cases where the hazard potential” is\nlow enough that remote isolation equipment is probably not justified. But if any of the four primary selection\ncriteria apply, remote isolation equipment should be installed as a precautionary approach [53, pp. 7, 17-18].\nApplying the HSG244 selection criteria to KMCO’s isobutylene system shows that remote isolation should have\nbeen added in this case, because three of the four criteria for remote isolation applied:\n• The maximum foreseeable release in the event of failure to manually isolate the release was more\nthan 1,100 pounds of isobutylene (an extremely flammable material);\n• Manual isolation required employees to enter a flammable atmosphere, exposing them to a serious\ninjury risk; and\n• The rate and duration of the release created a danger of a fatality or serious injury [53, p. 18].d\na Other industry standards, good practice guidance, and earlier CSB reports have described similar isolation equipment using different\nnames, including emergency block valve (EBV), emergency isolation valve (EIV), remotely operated block valve (RBV), emergency\nshutdown valve (ESDV), or remotely operated shutoff valve (ROSOV).\nb HSE says, “One of the conclusions of the Associated Octel report was that the incident escalated rapidly because it was not possible to\nstop the initial release” [53, p. 5, 74].\nc HSE’s report on the Grangemouth incident noted, “The control room operator was limited in the extent to which he could assist to\nisolate inventories remotely because many isolations could only be done manually” [97, p. 44].\nd The fourth selection criteria applied to toxic chemical releases.\nPage 56\nInvestigation Report\nIn HSG244, HSE warns, “Manual valves should never be used in situations where the employee effecting the\nisolation would be placed in danger. This is a major consideration in deciding when to use ROSOVs” [53, p. 14]\n(emphasis in the original). For flammable substances, HSE further says, “employees should not be required to\ndeliberately enter a flammable atmosphere to isolate plant manually, especially as personal protective equipment\n(PPE), is not a practicable solution” [53, p. 14].\nAmong the benefits of using remote isolation, HSG244 highlights the importance of preventing vapor cloud\nexplosions that could harm people and cause substantial property damage. HSG244 states:\nThe potential for escalation is much greater for flammable substances, particularly in\ncomplex plant with significant areas of congestion due to closely spaced plant, pipework\nand other structures. When ignition occurs in a congested area there is an increased risk\nof a vapour cloud explosion. The overpressure from a vapour cloud explosion may be\ncapable of critically damaging other plant, leading to further loss of containment and\npotential casualties [53, p. 14].\n4.2.2 American Petroleum Institute (API) Safety Guidance\nIn October 2012, the API published its second edition of API Recommended Practice 553, Refinery Valves and\nAccessories for Control and Safety Instrumented Systems [54]. In API RP 553, the API notes that its safety\nguidance captures industry knowledge and experience and provides proven solutions to well-known problems,\nsuch as remote isolation [54, p. 1]. The API uses the term emergency block valve to describe the equipment used\nto isolate flammable or toxic materials remotely in the event of a leak or fire [54, p. 94]. The API recommends\nplacing control stations for emergency block valves at least 50 to 100 feet away from the valve in a “remote\nmanned location” (safe location) [54, p. 97].\nAPI RP 553 states that remote isolation is “needed” for vessels containing isobutylene [54, p. 95]. For pumps,\nAPI RP 553 says that an emergency block valve is “needed” if the upstream vessel contains more than 4,000\ngallons of liquid hydrocarbon and is “typically required” where the upstream vessel contains more than 2,000\ngallons of light ends, such as isobutylene [54, p. 95]. At the time of the April 2, 2019, incident, KMCO’s\nisobutylene storage tank contained more than 29,000 gallons of liquid isobutylene. Had KMCO followed the\nexisting safety guidance for remote isolation in API RP 553, Refinery Valves and Accessories for Control and\nSafety Instrumented Systems, the isobutylene system should have been equipped with emergency block valves.\n4.2.3 CCPS Safety Guidance\nIn 2003, the CCPS provided guidance for remote isolation equipment in its book Guidelines for Fire Protection\nin Chemical, Petrochemical, and Hydrocarbon Processing Facilities [55]. In the book, the CCPS explains that\nprocess unit fires continue until the flow of fuel can be stopped, the fuel is consumed, or the fire is extinguished\n[55, p. 123]. The CCPS also provides general guidance on when to provide remote isolation capability. For\nexample, the CCPS states:\nEquipment such as pumps, compressors, tanks, and vessels associated with large\ninventories of flammable gas or liquid (>5,000 gallons) should be provided with\nPage 57\nInvestigation Report\nequipment emergency isolation valves to stop the flow of material if a leak occurs [55, p.\n123].\nIn addition, the CCPS provides a decision flowchart as an example of a tool that companies could use to decide\nwhere remote isolation equipment should be installed [55, p. 267]. As illustrated in Figure 23, applying this tool\nto KMCO’s isobutylene system shows that remote isolation equipment should have been provided.\nFigure 23. Remote Isolation Decision Flowchart. (Credit: CCPS, annotations by CSB)\nPage 58\nInvestigation Report\nThe CSB concludes that although the need to provide\nworkers with effective remote isolation capability has\nKey Lesson\nbeen well established by existing industry standards and\nThe goal of keeping workers safe and the goal of\ngood practice safety guidance documents, KMCO’s\nquickly isolating releases to minimize the\nisobutylene system remained unprotected.

This report details that there was an existing recommendation from a previous insurance\nreport in 2010 to provide remote isolation capability for certain equipment with the potential to have a spill of\nflammable liquid or that could result in a flammable vapor cloud, including isobutylene. The 2010\nrecommendation was included in the 2017 report and states:\nExpand the existing PHA program to include the analysis of the largest flammable liquid\nrelease sources and commit to the installation of fire-safe, remote-actuated automatic\nisolation valves in strategic process areas that will best achieve spill prevention especially\nthose involving ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, and isobutylene that create a flammable\nliquid / vapor cloud spill potential due to large liquid hold-up inventories from vessels\nand transfer piping. Reference API 553 for additional details.\nNote: Once the study is completed a policy should be developed for any future installation\nof EIVs.\nObservations & Issues\nThe placement of EIVs on vessels with significant hold-up inventories of hazardous\nmaterials within them would limit the amount released in an emergency thus reducing the\npossibility of a major incident.\nThe report stated that the lack of remote isolation capability has the potential for a significant incident and\nrecommends providing remote isolation capability at the “earliest opportunity.” The 2017 report indicated that\nKMCO had installed remote isolation valves for five vessels, but these vessels were not associated with the\na The isobutylene release could have been stopped from a safe location by turning off the circulation pump in the field near the\nisobutylene storage tank. KMCO designed the actuated on/off ball valve at the inlet to the charge pump to close automatically if the\nflow meter at the outlet of the circulation pump registered low flow (Figure 3).\nPage 59\nInvestigation Report\nApril 2, 2019, incident. The status update also noted that additional EIVs were planned in the future, but the\nreport did not specify which vessels were included in this plan.\nA different company conducted an insurance assessment and produced a report in March 2018. The 2010\nrecommendation to provide remote isolation capability was reiterated in this 2018 report, including the status\nidentified in the 2017 report. The 2018 report stated:\nThe facility indicates that when risk and hazard reviews are conducted consideration\nbased on risk and exposures determine whether additional EIV or interlocks shall be\nadded for existing or new installations. It may be of benefit for KMCO/KMTEX to\ndevelop a formal procedure/policy to address where retrofit conditions, MOC or new\n[construction] requires the installation of EIVs.\nDespite the 2010 insurance audit recommendation that KMCO use its PHA program to provide remote isolation\ncapability for high-hazard systems, including isobutylene, neither the 2014 PHA nor the 2015 PHA included any\ndiscussion of remote isolation or recommendations to equip the isobutylene system with remote isolation valves.\nIn addition, KMCO’s PHA procedure in place at the time of the April 2, 2019, incident was last updated in\nOctober 2017. This policy did not include any requirements or guidance for KMCO’s PHA teams to evaluate the\nneed for remote isolation valves. Furthermore, the 2018 PHA team did not document any discussion or\nconsideration about the potential need for remote isolation equipment for the isobutylene storage tank, piping, or\nbatch reactor system.\nThe CSB concludes that KMCO did not complete the implementation of the 2010 insurance recommendation to\nprovide remote isolation capability in strategic process areas, including the isobutylene system. Had KMCO\nfully implemented this recommendation, for example by providing remote shutoff capability for the actuated\non/off ball valve installed on the charge pump’s inlet piping, Board Operator 1 could have isolated the\nisobutylene release from a safe location—the blast-resistant Reaction Control Room. The quantity of\nisobutylene released and the severity of the incident could have been significantly reduced.\nAlthough the need to provide workers with effective remote isolation equipment has been well-established,\nsome facilities in the U.S. chemical industry remain unprotected. The CSB deployed investigation teams to four\nincidents in 2019. One common safety issue identified in each of the CSB investigation reports for these\naccidental release events is that effective remote isolation equipment could have reduced the amount of\nflammable material released and prevented great harm to people and neighboring communities. These incidents\nwere:\n• Storage Tank Fire at Intercontinental Terminals Company, LLC (ITC) Terminal in Deer Park,\nTexas on March 17, 2019;\n• Fatal Equipment Rupture, Explosion, and Fire at the KMCO Chemical Facility in Crosby, Texas\non April 2, 2019. (The subject of this report);\n• Fire and Explosions at Philadelphia Energy Solutions Refinery Hydrofluoric Acid Alkylation Unit\nin Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on June 21, 2019; and\n• Popcorn Polymer Accumulation, Pipe Rupture, Explosions, and Fires at TPC Group Chemical\nPlant Butadiene Unit in Port Neches, Texas on November 27, 2019.\nPage 60\nInvestigation Report\nDue to the frequency in which remote isolation has been identified as a safety issue in recent investigation\nreports, the CSB plans to develop and issue a remote isolation advocacy product in 2024.\nHazard Evaluation\nHazard evaluation is a broad topic. This term is used to describe efforts to identify and control hazards in\neveryday work tasks (job hazard analysis) as well as the formal multi-day efforts specifically designed to\nassemble a multi-disciplinary team of experts for the specific purpose of trying to locate and control potential\nhazards in a new process unit (process hazard analysis).\nIn addition, hazard evaluation is not a new process safety concept within the chemical industry. Trevor Kletz’s\nbook, HAZOP AND HAZAN: Identifying and Assessing Process Industry Hazards, devotes a chapter to\nreviewing the history of how this now-common hazard evaluation technique was developed at ICI (Imperial\nChemical Industries) during the 1960s [56, 57].\nOSHA considers hazard evaluation to be among the most important elements of its PSM standard.a According to\nOSHA, hazard evaluation involves an organized “effort to identify and analyze the significance of potential\nhazards associated with the processing or handling of highly hazardous chemicals,” including isobutylene [58, p.\n6412]. For processes like KMCO’s isobutylene system, OSHA’s PSM standard establishes the minimum\nrequirements for preventing or minimizing catastrophic releases, including the major fire or explosion hazards\nfrom flammable chemical releases that present a danger to workers. Among these requirements, the OSHA PSM\nstandard includes hazard evaluation requirements for the process hazard analysis (PHA), management of change\n(MOC), and pre-startup safety review (PSSR) elements.b\nIn its book, Guidelines for Hazard Evaluation Procedures, the CCPS emphasizes the importance of hazard\nevaluation. The CCPS states that “Hazard evaluation is the cornerstone of an organization’s overall process\nsafety management (PSM) program” [59, p. 11].c\nThis section reviews and analyzes the hazard evaluation efforts that KMCO applied to its isobutylene system\nbetween 2014 and 2018.\n4.3.1 2014 PHA\nOn September 29, 2014, KMCO performed a PHA as part of its project to install the new isobutylene system,\nincluding the storage tank, circulation pump and piping, and charge pump and piping. This PHA identified the\npotential for high-pressure conditions to develop within portions of the piping from liquid thermal expansion,\nand also identified the need for pressure-relief valves to protect the inlet and outlet piping for the circulation\na 29 C.F.R. § 1910.119.\nb 29 C.F.R. § 1910.119.\nc The CCPS identified 10 different names (synonyms) that have been used for hazard evaluation. Some of the names have slight\nvariations in meaning, but all of them relate back to the concept of identifying a hazard and making some assessment about its\nsignificance. These other names for “hazard evaluation” included process hazard(s) analysis, process hazard(s) review, process safety\nreview, process risk review, predictive hazard evaluation, hazard assessment, process risk survey, hazard study, hazard and risk\nanalysis, and hazard identification and risk analysis [59, p. 16].\nPage 61\nInvestigation Report\npump. No thermal expansion hazards were identified for the charge pump piping, but at that time, the project’s\npiping and instrumentation diagram (P&ID) did not include a check valve, y-strainer, or manual isolation valves\non the inlet piping to the charge pump.\n4.3.2 2015 PHA\nIn January 2015, KMCO performed a PHA of the isobutylene system that existed before the new system (shown\nin Figure 3) was commissioned. This PHA was poorly documented. For example, of the 16 nodes evaluated,\nonly two nodes were labeled to show the part of the system that was being analyzed.a The PHA contained no\ninformation to support a conclusion that the team evaluated liquid thermal expansion hazards for the isobutylene\npiping system.\n4.3.3 Isobutylene System MOC and PSSR\nIn its PSM standard, OSHA highlights the importance of performing a safety review before any highly\nhazardous chemicals like isobutylene are introduced into a process [60, p. 18].b To address this need for a safety\nreview, OSHA requires employers to perform a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for new or modified facilities\n(such as KMCO’s new isobutylene system) when the modification is significant enough that it requires a change\nin the process safety information. Among other requirements, the PSSR requires a hazard evaluation (PHA),\nmanagement of change (MOC), and confirmation that construction and equipment followed design\nspecifications.c\nOn January 26, 2015, KMCO initiated its MOC documentation for the new isobutylene system project. This\nMOC described the reasons for installing the new system, which included:\n• Relocating the isobutylene storage away from the process equipment area and increasing the\nisobutylene storage capacity from 20,000 gallons to 70,000 gallons;\n• Providing the capability to receive isobutylene shipments from railcars instead of tank trucks,\nwhich reduced truck traffic and addressed safety concerns raised about unloading isobutylene\ntrucks next to a hot oil furnace; and\n• Increasing production capacity of its sulfurized isobutylene product.\nKMCO management approved the MOC document in May 2015. Notably, the MOC package included the same\npiping and instrumentation diagram (P&ID) that was used in the 2014 PHA, which did not show a check valve,\ny-strainer, or manual isolation valves on the inlet piping to the charge pump. The P&ID showed that the\nisobutylene circulation piping and charge pump’s inlet piping would be made from type 304 stainless steel. The\nMOC package also included a list of materials and their estimated cost. The construction material identified in\nthe project materials list for piping or similar components was 304 stainless steel.\na The CCPS defines a node as “Sections of equipment with definite boundaries (e.g., a line between two vessels) within which process\nparameters are investigated for deviations. The locations on P&IDs at which the process parameters are investigated for deviations (e.g.,\na reactor). The concept of dividing a process into nodes for analysis is commonly, but not exclusively, used in HAZOPs” [86].\nb 29 C.F.R. § 1910.119(i).\nc 29 C.F.R. § 1910.119(i).\nPage 62\nInvestigation Report\nThe project PSSR was initiated on September 1, 2015, and completed on October 21, 2015. One item on the\nPSSR checklist addressed the construction material. This item indicated that the piping system was constructed\nof 304 stainless steel. Nothing in the PSSR discussed the y-strainer or identified that it was not constructed from\n304 stainless steel. In addition, nothing in the PSSR identified that the check valve or y-strainer had been\ninstalled in the charge pump’s inlet piping.\n4.3.4 Y-Strainer Cracked in 2015\n“It is tragic the number of times people are harmed in accidents\nwhere earlier warning signs had been overlooked” [61, p. 120].\nIn 2012, the CCPS published Recognizing Catastrophic Incident Warning Signs in the Process Industries, a\nbook focused on recognizing “indicators that something is wrong or about to go wrong” and taking action to\nprevent a major incident [62, pp. 1-3]. In the book’s Introduction, the CCPS states:\nWarning signs are indicators that something is wrong or about to go wrong. When we\nrecognize and act on these indicators, a loss may be prevented. Of course, this will only\nhappen when we know what to look for and are willing to take the initiative to do\nsomething about it. A review of significant incidents in the process industries suggests\nthat most if not all incidents were preceded by warning signs. Some of these signs were\nclearly visible but not acted upon because their significance was not understood. Other\nwarning signs were less obvious, but observant personnel may have detected them [62,\np. 1].\nThe y-strainer that catastrophically failed on April 2, 2019, was not the original strainer that KMCO installed for\nthis application during the 2014–2015 isobutylene storage tank and piping project.\nKMCO’s incident and maintenance records show that on December 10, 2015, an operator and his trainee\ndetected an isobutylene odor near the sulfurized isobutylene reactor system. The two workers found that the cast\niron y-strainer was leaking. The operator responded to the leak by spraying the area with water to knock down\nthe flammable vapor. The operator then called the shift supervisor and lead operator, who came out to the batch\nreactor system, evaluated the situation, and decided to shut down all work in the unit. KMCO workers then\nisolated the leaking equipment and vented the isobutylene into the flare system. After removing the isobutylene\nfrom the equipment, KMCO workers flushed the system with water and prepared it for maintenance. KMCO\nmaintenance workers replaced the leaking y-strainer (in kind replacement) that same day.\nPage 63\nInvestigation Report\nThe y-strainer that failed in December 2015 was later leak-tested\nwith water and found to have a crack through a wall of the body in Key Lesson\nthe same general area where the April 2019 strainer ruptured.\nPrevious incidents can provide a\nKMCO did not provide the CSB with an investigation report or\nwarning sign of problems that exist in\ncorrective actions that addressed the causes of the 2015 incident.\na system. Companies can prevent\nBased on the equipment configuration at the time of the\nfuture incidents by effectively\ncatastrophic y-strainer rupture in 2019, the CSB concludes that after\nrecognizing and acting on these earlier\nthe isobutylene system y-strainer failed in 2015, KMCO’s\nwarnings to identify and correct the\ninvestigation did not result in any significant changes or obvious underlying issues.\nimprovements specifically intended to prevent a future y-strainer\nfailure.\n4.3.5 2018 PHA\nAs part of the company’s efforts to strengthen its safety management systems, KMCO performed a “re-do” of its\nisobutylene system process hazard analysis in November 2018. A re-do PHA is an approach in which the PHA\nrevalidation is essentially a new PHA, “where the team starts from the beginning and performs the entire PHA\nin detail as if it were an initial PHA” [63, p. 92]. The PHA team consisted of eight members. Seven of the PHA\nmembers were KMCO employees with an average of 16 years of professional experience. The PHA was\nfacilitated by a contractor with 42 years of professional experience.\nKMCO’s 2018 PHA report clearly stated that the isobutylene system was a covered process under both the\nOSHA PSM standard and the EPA RMP rule. In addition, this PHA clarified that the pressure-relief valve on the\ncharge pump’s outlet piping was normally aligned to relieve (discharge) back into the charge pump’s inlet\npiping, as shown in Figure 3. As part of its facility siting evaluation, the PHA team documented that the R2\nBuilding still contained electrical equipment that could ignite flammable vapors. The team identified that the\ndoors to the R2 Building “are always closed but not tightly.” The team noted that a new motor control center\nwas being built and made no additional recommendations about this building.\nKMCO’s 2018 PHA did not document an analysis of the potential high-pressure scenarios that could develop in\nthe isobutylene piping from liquid thermal expansion hazards. As a result, the two pressure-relief valves in the\nisobutylene circulation piping, installed following the project hazard evaluation in 2014, were not identified as\nsafeguards. In addition, the 2018 PHA documentation did not specifically discuss the potential for liquid thermal\nexpansion to occur in the charge pump’s inlet piping.\nFurthermore, the 2018 PHA used a P&ID that showed the charge pump’s inlet piping was constructed from\nstainless steel. The CSB did not identify any information in the PHA documentation indicating that the y-\nstrainer material of construction was cast iron or that the strainer was made from a different material than the\n304 stainless steel piping.\n4.3.6 KMCO’s Hazard Evaluations\nWarning signs are indicators that something is wrong or may soon go wrong. KMCO’s 2018 PHA team did not\nevaluate the incident on December 10, 2015, in which a crack developed in the body of the y-strainer, releasing\nPage 64\nInvestigation Report\nisobutylene. The 2018 PHA report stated: “Previous incidents and near misses for the [isobutylene system] since\n2016 were discussed by the PHA team.” The report did not elaborate or otherwise explain why the incidents or\nnear misses from 2015 were not reviewed. Because the 2015 PHA was conducted in January 2015, the 2015\nPHA team could not have included a review of the failed y-strainer event on December 10, 2015, because that\nevent had not yet happened.\nThe CSB concludes that KMCO’s y-strainer failure in 2015 should have served as a warning sign of the\npotential for liquid thermal expansion or other high-pressure scenarios within the charge pump’s inlet piping.\nHad KMCO effectively recognized and acted on this earlier warning through an incident investigation or PHA\nrevalidation, the company could have taken corrective actions that may have prevented the April 2, 2019,\nincident.\nOf all the hazard evaluations KMCO performed for its isobutylene system, only the hazard evaluation carried\nout for the isobutylene system project in 2014 documented an evaluation of liquid thermal expansion hazards for\nthe isobutylene piping, and that study used an engineering drawing for the charge pump piping that did not\ninclude the check valve, the y-strainer, or manual isolation valves. The full history of the isobutylene system\nhazard evaluations shows that KMCO never identified or controlled the potential for liquid thermal expansion to\ndevelop high-pressure conditions within the charge pump’s inlet piping.\nThe CSB concludes that KMCO never protected the charge pump’s inlet piping from liquid thermal expansion\nor high-pressure conditions that could develop from other potential scenarios that could have weakened or\notherwise damaged the cast iron y-strainer.\nPHA teams rely on process safety information such as P&IDs during review meetings. For example, in its book\nGuidelines for Revalidating a Process Hazard Analysis, the CCPS states: “P&IDs serve as the ‘road map’ for\nstudy sessions” [63, p. 115]. The CSB found that none of the KMCO hazard evaluations included any specific\ndiscussion, mention, or reference about the cast iron y-strainer installed in the inlet piping to the charge pump.\nKMCO’s P&IDs did not specifically identify that this y-strainer was constructed from cast iron. In fact, these\ndrawings indicated that the y-strainer’s construction material was stainless steel. KMCO had two different\nP&IDs that showed the charge pump and the y-strainer. One of these P&IDs showed “SS,” a common\nabbreviation for stainless steel, directly above the y-strainer symbol. The second P&ID identified the charge\npump’s inlet piping as being 3-inch, schedule 40 stainless steel piping with 300-lb flanges, using the\nabbreviation 3”-SS-300#SCH 40. Since the P&ID did not indicate a piping specification break at the y-strainer,\na reviewer of this drawing would likely conclude that the y-strainer material of construction was stainless steel.\nIn its Guidelines for Hazard Evaluation Procedures book, the CCPS explained that performing a successful\nhazard evaluation requires the study team to have access to accurate information, such as P&IDs. The CCPS\nstated:\nHazard evaluations are based on existing knowledge of a process or operation. If the\nprocess chemistry is not well known, if the relevant drawings or procedures are not\naccurate, or if the process knowledge available from a study team does not reflect the\nway the system is actually operated, then the results of a hazard evaluation may be invalid\n[59, p. 13].\nPage 65\nInvestigation Report\nThe CSB concludes that KMCO’s hazard evaluations consistently overlooked or misunderstood the hazards\nintroduced when the cast iron y-strainer was added to the charge pump’s inlet piping. Most of KMCO’s hazard\nevaluations used drawings that did not include the y-strainer, and although the 2018 re-do PHA used drawings\nshowing the y-strainer, these drawings showed it to be made from stainless steel. Had any of these previous\nhazard evaluations identified that the y-strainer was constructed from cast iron and recognized that good practice\nsafety guidance either prohibited or warned against using cast iron in hazardous applications, including\nflammable hydrocarbons such as isobutylene, KMCO might have installed a y-strainer made from a ductile\nmaterial, which could have reduced the severity of the incident and may have prevented it.\nPage 66\nInvestigation Report\n5 Conclusions\nFindings\nTechnical Analysis\nThe cast iron y-strainer that catastrophically failed on April 2, 2019, ruptured from a brittle overload\nfracture driven by internal pressure.\nExisting industry standards and good practice safety guidance show that cast iron is a brittle material that\nshould not have been used for an application such as KMCO’s liquid isobutylene piping system.\nThe most likely source of pressure contributing to the y-strainer failure was liquid isobutylene thermal\nexpansion that might have periodically occurred within the charge pump’s inlet piping, which was not\nequipped with a pressure-relief device or otherwise protected from high-pressure conditions.\nAlthough a number of potential sources of ignition existed in the area of the isobutylene release, the source\nof ignition that triggered the isobutylene explosion was most likely located within the R2 Building.\nEmergency Response\nKMCO never activated its facility alarm system to notify all workers about the isobutylene release\nemergency. As a result, some injured workers were nearer to the explosion than they should have been.\nKMCO could have reduced the severity of the event by using its facility alarm system to notify all workers\nof the isobutylene release emergency and communicate the evacuation order.\nKMCO’s emergency response system, including its procedures and training, contributed to the severity of\nthe incident. KMCO did not establish procedures or provide training that effectively distinguished the\nincidents that its operators should respond to from the emergency events that the site’s emergency response\nteam must respond to. As a result of KMCO’s emergency response program, the emergency actions taken\nby KMCO operations staff to stop the isobutylene release adhered to the unwritten culture at KMCO that\nrelied on unit operators taking quick actions to stop a chemical release. When the isobutylene release began,\nworkers who were in a safe location moved toward the isobutylene vapor cloud, which put them in harm’s\nway. KMCO could have reduced the severity of the event by establishing clear policies and training its\nworkforce to respond to a chemical release without putting themselves in harm’s way.\nRemote Isolation\nAlthough the need to provide workers with effective remote isolation capability has been well established by\nexisting industry standards and good practice safety guidance documents, KMCO’s isobutylene system\nremained unprotected. As a result, when the y-strainer ruptured on April 2, 2019, KMCO workers did not\nstop the isobutylene release remotely, from a safe location. KMCO could have reduced the severity of its\nApril 2, 2019, incident if the company had provided its Board Operators with the capability to remotely\nisolate the isobutylene release from within the blast-resistant Reaction Control Room—a safe location.\nPage 67\nInvestigation Report\nKMCO did not complete the implementation of the 2010 insurance recommendation to provide remote\nisolation capability in strategic process areas, including the isobutylene system. Had KMCO fully\nimplemented this recommendation, for example by providing remote shutoff capability for the actuated\non/off ball valve installed on the charge pump’s inlet piping, Board Operator 1 could have isolated the\nisobutylene release from a safe location—the blast-resistant Reaction Control Room. The quantity of\nisobutylene released and the severity of the incident could have been significantly reduced.\nHazard Evaluation\nAfter the isobutylene system y-strainer failed in 2015, KMCO’s investigation did not result in any\nsignificant changes or obvious improvements specifically intended to prevent a future y-strainer failure.\nKMCO’s y-strainer failure in 2015 should have served as a warning sign of the potential for liquid thermal\nexpansion or other high-pressure scenarios within the charge pump’s inlet piping. Had KMCO effectively\nrecognized and acted on this earlier warning through an incident investigation or PHA revalidation, the\ncompany could have taken corrective actions that may have prevented the April 2, 2019, incident.\nKMCO never protected the charge pump’s inlet piping from liquid thermal expansion or high-pressure\nconditions that could develop from other potential scenarios that could have weakened or otherwise\ndamaged the cast iron y-strainer.\nKMCO’s hazard evaluations consistently overlooked or misunderstood the hazards introduced when the cast\niron y-strainer was added to the charge pump’s inlet piping. Most of KMCO’s hazard evaluations used\ndrawings that did not include the y-strainer, and although the 2018 re-do PHA used drawings showing the y-\nstrainer, these drawings showed it to be made from stainless steel. Had any of these previous hazard\nevaluations identified that the y-strainer was constructed from cast iron and recognized that good practice\nsafety guidance either prohibited or warned against using cast iron in hazardous applications, including\nflammable hydrocarbons such as isobutylene, KMCO might have installed a y-strainer made from a ductile\nmaterial, which could have reduced the severity of the incident and may have prevented it.\nPage 68\nInvestigation Report\nCause\nThe CSB determined that the cause of the isobutylene release was a brittle overload fracture of the cast iron y-\nstrainer driven by internal pressure. The y-strainer was installed in a segment of the isobutylene piping that was\nnot protected from the high-pressure conditions that developed within this equipment, most likely from liquid\nthermal expansion. The isobutylene vapor cloud was most likely ignited by electrical equipment within a poorly\nsealed, nearby building.\nKMCO’s hazard evaluation programs, including process hazard analysis, pre-startup safety review, and\nmanagement of change, also contributed to the incident. KMCO’s hazard evaluations consistently overlooked or\nmisunderstood that its y-strainer was made from cast iron, a brittle material that existing industry standards and\ngood practice guidance documents either prohibit or warn against using in hazardous applications, such as the\ncompany’s isobutylene system. In addition, none of KMCO’s hazard evaluations identified the potential for\nliquid thermal expansion or other possible scenarios to develop high-pressure conditions within the piping\nsystem that included the y-strainer. As a result, unlike other portions of KMCO’s isobutylene piping, this piping\nsection was not equipped with a pressure-relief device to protect it from potential high-pressure conditions.\nKMCO did not provide safety equipment that its workers could have used to remotely stop (isolate) the\nisobutylene release from a safe location, which contributed to the severity of the incident. Deficiencies in\nKMCO’s emergency response system, including its procedures and training, also contributed to the severity of\nthe incident by not effectively distinguishing which events its operators should handle from those incidents that\nthe site’s emergency response team must respond to. Because KMCO relied on its unit operators to take quick\nactions to stop chemical releases, workers who were in a safe location moved toward the flammable isobutylene\nvapor cloud, which put them in harm’s way. KMCO could have reduced the severity of the event by establishing\nclear policies and training its workforce to respond to a chemical release without putting themselves in harm’s\nway.\nPage 69\nInvestigation Report\n6 Recommendations\nFollowing its April 2, 2019, incident, KMCO filed for bankruptcy, and the company is no longer in business.\nAltivia Oxide Chemicals, LLC (Altivia) purchased the Crosby, Texas, facility in 2020 and informed the CSB\nthat the process involved in the incident would be dismantled as part of Altivia’s efforts to install two new oxide\nreactors and start production by the end of 2020. As a result, the CSB is not issuing recommendations with this\nreport.\nNevertheless, the CSB urges Altivia to read this report closely and understand the factors that led to the incident\nat the KMCO facility and the lessons stemming from it. Moreover, if hereafter Altivia reinitiates the process or\nany equipment involved in this incident, the company should ensure that the facts, conditions, and circumstances\nthat caused the incident—and contributed to its severity—are not repeated.\nPage 70\nInvestigation Report\n7 Key Lessons\nTo prevent future chemical incidents, and in the interest of driving chemical safety excellence to protect\ncommunities, workers, and the environment, the CSB urges companies to review these key lessons:\n1. Cast iron is widely recognized as a brittle material that should not be used in hazardous applications,\nincluding applications that involve flammable or toxic chemicals.\n2. Piping systems should be equipped with protection from high-pressure conditions, where liquid thermal\nexpansion or other scenarios can create a hazard. For example, API 521 recommends installing a pressure-\nrelief device if liquid thermal expansion is a credible hazard.\n3. Reliable facility alarm systems can help ensure effective emergency communication to alert people of\ndanger and inform them of what actions are needed to protect life and health.\n4. Where remote isolation is not provided or is otherwise not available, clear policies and effective training are\nneeded to help ensure that workers do not put themselves in danger to stop a chemical release.\n5. Emergency response plans, including procedures and training, need to effectively distinguish between\nincidents that plant workers should respond to and emergency events that must be handled by a qualified\nemergency response team.\n6. The goal of keeping workers safe and the goal of quickly isolating releases to minimize the consequences of\nan incident should not be mutually exclusive. Both can be achieved by applying robust safety systems and\nestablishing effective emergency response programs. Providing remotely operated emergency isolation\nvalves in strategic locations can allow workers to stop a release quickly from a safe location.\n7. Previous incidents can provide a warning sign of problems that exist in a system. Companies can prevent\nfuture incidents by effectively recognizing and acting on these earlier warnings to identify and correct the\nunderlying issues.\nPage 71\nInvestigation Report\n8 References\n[1] KMCO, \"KMCO | About Us,\" 2019.

The y-strainer ruptured about 4 hours and 16 minutes after the isobutylene charge was\ncompleted.\n• April 2, 2019, at 10:45 a.m. (control system: 10:45:28 (calculation) | Video 10:44:21 (estimate)),\nBoard Operator 1 makes a radio call to evacuate from the reaction area.b\n• April 2, 2019, at about 10:46 a.m. (control system: 10:46:08), manual valves were closed to stop\nthe isobutylene release. About 10,000 pounds of isobutylene were released in 5 minutes and 25\nseconds.\n• April 2, 2019, at 10:47 a.m. (control system: 10:46:52 (calculation) | Video 10:45:45 (estimate)),\nthe Shift Supervisor made a radio call ordering a plant evacuation.\n• April 2, 2019, at 10:51 a.m. (control system: 10:51:28 | Video: 10:50:21), the isobutylene vapor\ncloud ignited and exploded. The explosion occurred about 10 minutes and 45 seconds after the y-\nstrainer ruptured and 5 minutes and 20 seconds after the isobutylene release was stopped.\n• April 2, 2019, at 10:54 a.m., (control system: 10:54:12 (calculation) | Video: 10:53:05) three\nminutes after the explosion, the first member of KMCO’s ERT was wearing their protective gear\nand headed toward the unit.\n• May 8, 2020, KMCO filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\n• May 29, 2020, Crosby, Texas, facility sold to Altivia Oxide Chemicals, LLC.\na Former Student Spotlight Arthur “Artie” McFerrin Jr. [96].\nb Surveillance video estimates are based on witness interviews describing key people being in an office or conference room, hearing the\nradio call, and then leaving the office or conference room to take some action. The video shows when they left the office or conference\nroom. The estimate is that the plant radio call occurred five seconds before they appeared in the video. The time difference between the\ncontrol system and the video is about 67 seconds and is based on the visible shaking of the video image and the loss of key data signals\nwithin the control system.\nPage 77\nInvestigation Report\nAppendix C: Surrounding Area Demographics\nFigure 24 shows the census blocks within one mile of the KMCO facility.

However, within 34 h after\npressure testing, one of the pressure vessels\nexploded (Fig. 62), and within a few days,\nmost of the other pressure vessels had failed.\nIt was determined that the cracking was\nSCC, but the source of the corrosive fluid\nresponsible for the SCC could not be imme-\ndiately determined. Pressure vessels of the\nsamedesigndidnotexhibitSCCwhentested\nwith N O by Rockwell. However, the same\n2 4\ntesting conducted by the RCS tank contrac-\ntor, Bell Aerosystems Company, did result\nin SCC.\nChemical testing of the propellants used at\nBell and Rockwell revealed no differences\nor out-of-specification conditions. Existing\nchemical techniques were not capable of\naccurately quantifying all species present in (a) (b)\nthe N O , especially compounds of nitrogen;\n2 4\nhowever, cooling the propellants revealed a Fig. 62 (a)PhotographoffailedApolloTi-6Al-4Vreactioncontrolsystemvesselafterexposuretopressurized\na c t ol B or el d l i a ff n e d re R nc o e ck in we N ll 2 , O i 4 nd b i e c t a w ti e n e g n a th d e if s f u e p r p e l n i c e e s O N2 ri O gi 4 na fo l r m 3 a 4 gn h ifi . c ( a b t ) io M n: ic 2 r 5 o 0 g (cid:4) raph of a cross section from the vessel exhibiting stress-corrosion cracks.\nincomposition.TheN O atRockwell,when\n2 4\ncooledto-18(cid:3)C(0(cid:3)F),turnedgreenbecause\nof the presence of nitric oxide (NO), but the\nN O atBellturnedyellowundersimilarcon-\n2 4\nditions.

Rockwell supplies of\nN O had been purchased earlier than those\n2 4\nof Bell Aerospace.\nDiscussion\nInvestigation revealed that a change in\nthe military specification MIL-P-26539 had\nbeen made during this period to improve\nthe specific impulse of N O by oxygenat-\n2 4 (a) (b)\ning with trace quantities of residual NO.\nThis simple change had a devastating effect\non the stress-corrosion behavior of tita- Fig. 63 MicrographsofcrosssectionspreparedadjacenttoaweldintheTi-6Al-4VApolloservicepropulsion\nsystem fuel pressure vessel that failed during a hydrostatic test using methanol.
